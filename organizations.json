Since many young Muslims had come to the United States to receive an education, the Muslim Brotherhood recognized that they could get better quality cadres by drawing from Muslims studying in the United States.”<br></p>MSA has also “sought and acquired funding to do a massive translation project of all the major texts of radical Islam,” including numerous texts from the Muslim Brotherhood ideological network.<p></p><p></p><p>The 2008 Hudson Institute report also <a href=\"https://www.hudson.org/content/researchattachments/attachment/1339/20080314_current_trends_volume6.pdf\" >noted </a>[p.90] that \"When American Muslim college students visited their school’s Muslim prayer room, they could choose any of these Islamist books to take home and to this day [they] remain available free of charge.”<br></p><h2>Founding</h2><p></p><p></p><p>According to a 2008 Hudson Institute report, “Current Trends in Islamist Ideology,” MSA was <a href=\"https://www.hudson.org/content/researchattachments/attachment/1339/20080314_current_trends_volume6.pdf\" >founded </a>[p.90] by an Iraqi Kurd, Jamal Barzanji [Jamal Barzinji] and his family network, “all of whom were associated with the Muslim Brotherhood,” as well as Ahmed Totonj, at UIUC.

Since many young Muslims had come to the United States to receive an education, the Muslim Brotherhood recognized that they could get better quality cadres by drawing from Muslims studying in the United States.”<br></p>MSA has also “sought and acquired funding to do a massive translation project of all the major texts of radical Islam,” including numerous texts from the Muslim Brotherhood ideological network.<p></p><p></p><p>The 2008 Hudson Institute report also <a href=\"https://www.hudson.org/content/researchattachments/attachment/1339/20080314_current_trends_volume6.pdf\" >noted </a>[p.90] that \"When American Muslim college students visited their school’s Muslim prayer room, they could choose any of these Islamist books to take home and to this day [they] remain available free of charge.”<br></p><h2>Founding</h2><p></p><p></p><p>According to a 2008 Hudson Institute report, “Current Trends in Islamist Ideology,” MSA was <a href=\"https://www.hudson.org/content/researchattachments/attachment/1339/20080314_current_trends_volume6.pdf\" >founded </a>[p.90] by an Iraqi Kurd, Jamal Barzanji [Jamal Barzinji] and his family network, “all of whom were associated with the Muslim Brotherhood,” as well as Ahmed Totonj, at UIUC.

    "snippet" : "<h2>Overview</h2><p><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_Pink\">CODEPINK: Women for Peace</a> is an anti-war activist group in the United States that engages in regular actions to harm the State of Israel. The organization aggressively <a href=\"http://www.codepink.org/justice_for_palestine\">promotes</a> the <a href=\"https://canarymission.org/organization/Boycott_Divestment_Sanctions\">Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS)</a> movement and has been criticized for <a href=\"http://www.israellycool.com/2014/06/04/hamas-code-pink-and-me/\">maintaining</a> close ties to the <a href=\"https://canarymission.org/organization/Hamas\">Hamas</a> regime in Gaza. </p><p>CODEPINK <a href=\"http://www.codepink.org/\">describes</a> itself as “a women-led grassroots organization working to end U.S. wars and militarism, support peace and human rights initiatives, and redirect our tax dollars into healthcare, education, green jobs and other life-affirming programs.”</p><p>With members wearing the group's signature pink color, CODEPINK has conducted marches, protests and high-visibility publicity stunts in pursuit of its goals. It has regional offices in Los Angeles, San Francisco, Washington, D.C. and New York. </p><h2>Background</h2><p>CODEPINK was founded on November 17, 2002 by <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jodie_Evans\">Jodie Evans</a>, <a href=\"https://canarymission.org/individual/Medea_Benjamin\">Medea Benjamin</a> and other anti-war activists. The group's name is a play on the United States Department of Homeland Security's <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homeland_Security_Advisory_System\">color-coded alert system</a> in which Code Red signifies the highest level of danger.</p><p>In September 2008, a number of CODEPINK leaders personally met with Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad in New York City. CODEPINK subsequently<a href=\"http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2010/01/12/hamas-terrorists-guaranteed-code-pinks-safety-in-gaza/\"> launched</a> an aggressive anti-Israel campaign that included <a href=\"https://www.solidarity-us.org/node/2159\">open support</a> for Hamas. That November, Jodie Evans and a CODEPINK contingent visited Iran at the personal invitation of Ahmadinejad.</p><h2>Meeting With Hamas</h2><p>In March 2009, CODEPINK <a href=\"https://www.solidarity-us.org/node/2159\">led</a> an international delegation of anti-Israel activists to Gaza. Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh <a href=\"http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2010/01/12/hamas-terrorists-guaranteed-code-pinks-safety-in-gaza/\">addressed</a> the activists in Gaza by phone while other Hamas officials addressed them in person. </p><p>Hamas <a href=\"http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2010/01/12/hamas-terrorists-guaranteed-code-pinks-safety-in-gaza/\">protected</a> the demonstrators during their two-day stay in Gaza by tightly controlling CODEPINK’s movements and contacts which <a href=\"http://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/pro-gaza-activists-under-siege-imposed-by-egypt-and-hamas-1.261009\">included</a> Palestinian homes, local NGO’s and Palestinian refugee camps run by the United Nations. Activists also stayed in a luxurious hotel owned by Hamas.</p><p>In 2009 CODEPINK further escalated the intensity of its international <a href=\"http://www.freerepublic.com/focus/f-news/2668242/posts\">campaign</a> to stop the blockade that Egypt and Israel had imposed on Gaza (to prevent the importation of weaponry) after <a href=\"http://www.discoverthenetworks.org/groupProfile.asp?grpid=6204\">Hamas</a>'s 2006 election as the region's dominant political entity. </p><p>CODEPINK helped to organize an “International Women's Day” delegation to Gaza in March of 2014. Upon arriving at the Cairo airport on March 3, 2014, however, Benjamin was detained by Egyptian authorities.

    "manualBackupText" : "<h2>Overview</h2><p><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_Pink\">CODEPINK: Women for Peace</a> is an anti-war activist group in the United States that engages in regular actions to harm the State of Israel. The organization aggressively <a href=\"http://www.codepink.org/justice_for_palestine\">promotes</a> the <a href=\"https://canarymission.org/organization/Boycott_Divestment_Sanctions\">Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS)</a> movement and has been criticized for <a href=\"http://www.israellycool.com/2014/06/04/hamas-code-pink-and-me/\">maintaining</a> close ties to the <a href=\"https://canarymission.org/organization/Hamas\">Hamas</a> regime in Gaza. </p><p>CODEPINK <a href=\"http://www.codepink.org/\">describes</a> itself as “a women-led grassroots organization working to end U.S. wars and militarism, support peace and human rights initiatives, and redirect our tax dollars into healthcare, education, green jobs and other life-affirming programs.”</p><p>With members wearing the group's signature pink color, CODEPINK has conducted marches, protests and high-visibility publicity stunts in pursuit of its goals. It has regional offices in Los Angeles, San Francisco, Washington, D.C. and New York. </p><h2>Background</h2><p>CODEPINK was founded on November 17, 2002 by <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jodie_Evans\">Jodie Evans</a>, <a href=\"https://canarymission.org/individual/Medea_Benjamin\">Medea Benjamin</a> and other anti-war activists. The group's name is a play on the United States Department of Homeland Security's <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homeland_Security_Advisory_System\">color-coded alert system</a> in which Code Red signifies the highest level of danger.</p><p>In September 2008, a number of CODEPINK leaders personally met with Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad in New York City. CODEPINK subsequently<a href=\"http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2010/01/12/hamas-terrorists-guaranteed-code-pinks-safety-in-gaza/\"> launched</a> an aggressive anti-Israel campaign that included <a href=\"https://www.solidarity-us.org/node/2159\">open support</a> for Hamas. That November, Jodie Evans and a CODEPINK contingent visited Iran at the personal invitation of Ahmadinejad.</p><h2>Meeting With Hamas</h2><p>In March 2009, CODEPINK <a href=\"https://www.solidarity-us.org/node/2159\">led</a> an international delegation of anti-Israel activists to Gaza. Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh <a href=\"http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2010/01/12/hamas-terrorists-guaranteed-code-pinks-safety-in-gaza/\">addressed</a> the activists in Gaza by phone while other Hamas officials addressed them in person. </p><p>Hamas <a href=\"http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2010/01/12/hamas-terrorists-guaranteed-code-pinks-safety-in-gaza/\">protected</a> the demonstrators during their two-day stay in Gaza by tightly controlling CODEPINK’s movements and contacts which <a href=\"http://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/pro-gaza-activists-under-siege-imposed-by-egypt-and-hamas-1.261009\">included</a> Palestinian homes, local NGO’s and Palestinian refugee camps run by the United Nations. Activists also stayed in a luxurious hotel owned by Hamas.</p><p>In 2009 CODEPINK further escalated the intensity of its international <a href=\"http://www.freerepublic.com/focus/f-news/2668242/posts\">campaign</a> to stop the blockade that Egypt and Israel had imposed on Gaza (to prevent the importation of weaponry) after <a href=\"http://www.discoverthenetworks.org/groupProfile.asp?grpid=6204\">Hamas</a>'s 2006 election as the region's dominant political entity. </p><p>CODEPINK helped to organize an “International Women's Day” delegation to Gaza in March of 2014. Upon arriving at the Cairo airport on March 3, 2014, however, Benjamin was detained by Egyptian authorities. She was reportedly <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/05/world/middleeast/medea-benjamin-cairo-airport.html?_r=0\">injured</a> by Egyptian security forces and <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/05/world/middleeast/medea-benjamin-cairo-airport.html?_r=0\">deported</a> to Turkey.

    "snippet" : "<h2>Overview</h2><p>The Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP) is a secular, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marxism%E2%80%93Leninism\">Marxist-Leninist</a> and Palestinian-Nationalist armed group. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Popular_Front_For_The_Liberation_Of_Palestine\">Founded</a> in 1967, the PFLP is <a href=\"http://archive.adl.org/terrorism/symbols/popular_front_pa1.html\">dedicated </a>to the violent destruction of Israel and Zionism. The group is <a href=\"http://www.state.gov/j/ct/rls/other/des/123085.htm\">designated</a> as a terrorist organization by the U.S., European Union, Canada, Australia and Israel. </p><p>The PFLP <a href=\"http://pflp.ps/english/1969/12/21/platform-of-the-popular-front-for-the-liberation-of-palestine-1969/\">views</a> its fight against Israel and Zionism as “first of all a class struggle.” The PFLP is also opposed to capitalist Arab states allied with the West and has always <a href=\"http://pflp.ps/english/2012/12/13/founding-document-of-the-popular-front-for-the-liberation-of-palestine-december-1967/\">considered</a> itself part of a broader revolutionary anti-imperialist, anti-capitalist and anti-colonialist movement, dedicated to building Communism.</p><p>The armed wing of the PFLP — the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abu_Ali_Mustapha_Brigades\">Abu Ali Mustapha Brigades</a> — has carried out numerous terror attacks in Israel. The wing is most <a href=\"http://pflp.ps/english/2012/07/09/pflp-in-dheisheh-refugee-camp-marches-in-memory-of-ghassan-kanafani/\">active</a> in the West Bank and has a presence in Gaza. The PFLP is also active in several Palestinian refugee camps in Syria and Lebanon. One of the PFLP’s most high-profile leaders, airline hijacker <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leila_Khaled\">Leila Khaled</a>, resides in Amman, Jordan.</p><p>The PFLP and its leaders — especially Khaled — <a href=\"https://canarymission.org/individual/Layla_Abdel-Jawad\">enjoy</a> significant <a href=\"https://canarymission.org/individual/Rachel_Gilmer\">popularity</a> with <a href=\"https://canarymission.org/organization/Students_For_Justice_In_Palestine\">Students for Justice in Palestine (SJP)</a> and the <a href=\"https://canarymission.org/organization/Boycott_Divestment_Sanctions\">Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS)</a> movement. </p><h2>Worldwide Terror Attacks </h2><p>The PFLP gained notoriety for its hijacking many civilian airplanes during the late 1960’s and early 1970’s. The organization hijacked several Israeli planes, as well as American and European airliners, from airports in Europe and the U.S. </p><p>PFLP operatives and members of the Japanese Red Army terror group <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lod_Airport_massacre\">killed</a> 26 people and injured another 80 in an attack at Lod International Airport (now Ben Gurion International Airport) in Israel, in 1972.</p><p>Among the most notable PFLP hijackings was the capture of an Air France plane, in 1976. The hijackers were members of a splinter group within the PFLP who flew the plane to Entebbe, Uganda, where they <a href=\"https://youtu.be/W3LTfZ1CZ1g?t=808\">separated</a> nearly 100 Jewish passengers from the others — and threatened to execute one per hour. Israel, however, launched a successful commando raid to rescue the hostages. </p><p>The PFLP also <a href=\"http://middleeast.about.com/od/terrorism/a/dawson-field-hijackings.htm\">carried</a> out the September 6, 1970 hijacking of four airliners taking off from New York, Brussels, Zurich and Frankfurt. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leila_Khaled\">Leila Khaled</a> took part in the operation. The incident concluded with three of the airplanes being blown up in Jordan, in front of international media cameras, after crew and passengers disembarked.</p><h2>Targeting Civilians </h2><p>The PFLP has attacked chiefly civilian targets, including the 1969 SuperSol supermarket bombing in Jerusalem that killed two foreign students. The bombing was masterminded and carried out by <a href=\"http://legalinsurrection.com/2015/09/the-sickening-deification-of-rasmea-odeh/\">Rasmea Odeh</a>, who has been elevated to iconic stature within anti-Israel groups like SJP and BDS. Odeh and the PFLP attempted to bomb the British consulate four days after the SuperSol bombing.</p><p>The PFLP <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/middle-east/jerusalem-synagogue-attack-popular-front-for-the-liberation-of-palestine-claims-responsibility-9868981.html\">claimed</a> “credit” for the 2001 <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2001/oct/17/israel2\">assassination </a>of Israeli Tourism Minister Rehavam Ze'evi and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Palestinian_suicide_attacks\">perpetrated</a> many suicide bombings against Israeli civilians during the second Intifada. These included the 2004 <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carmel_Market_bombing\">Carmel Market Bombing</a> in Tel Aviv —  where a 16-year-old PFLP terrorist murdered three Israelis and injured 30 more — and the 2002 <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karnei_Shomron_Mall_suicide_bombing\">Karnei Shomron suicide bombing</a>, which left three teenage Israeli girls dead  and injured 27 people. The suicide bomber detonated his bomb in the doorway of a pizza parlor. </p><p>In recent years, PFLP members carried out the March 2011 <a href=\"http://mfa.gov.il/MFA/ForeignPolicy/Terrorism/Palestinian/Pages/Two_Fogel_family_murderers_arrested_17-Apr-2011.aspx\">butchering</a> of five members of the Fogel Family — father Udi, mother Ruth, and eleven-year-old Yoav, four-year-old Elad and three-month-old infant Hadas. </p><p>PFLP members also <a href=\"http://jonathanhalevi.blogspot.com/2014/11/canadian-palestinian-samidoun.html\">carried</a> out the November 2014 Har Nof Massacre, where <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/middle-east/jerusalem-synagogue-attack-popular-front-for-the-liberation-of-palestine-claims-responsibility-9868981.html\">two terrorists</a> used a gun, axes and <a href=\"https://youtu.be/nGcvox0K_Tg?t=43\">butcher knife</a> to murder five Jewish <a href=\"http://mfa.gov.il/MFA/ForeignPolicy/Terrorism/Palestinian/Pages/Terror-attack-in-Jerusalem-synagogue-18-Nov-2014.aspx\">rabbis</a> during <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/19/world/middleeast/killings-in-jerusalem-synagogue-complex.html?_r=0\">morning prayers</a> in a Jerusalem synagogue. The attackers also killed a Druze police officer in the ensuing gunfight, before the terrorists were killed. PFLP Gaza leader, Hani Thawbta, <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/11/18/attack-on-jerusalem-synagogue_n_6175726.html\">stated</a>: “We declare full responsibility of the PFLP for the execution of this heroic operation...\"</p><h2>Background </h2><p>Since its <a href=\"http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/para/pflp.htm\">founding </a>in December 1967, until the fall of the Soviet Union (USSR) in 1991, the PFLP relied heavily upon funding from the major powers in the Communist bloc, namely the USSR and China. PFLP leader Wadie Haddad was later <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wadie_Haddad\">revealed</a> to be Soviet KGB agent. </p><p>In 1968, the PFLP joined the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestine_Liberation_Organization\">Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO)</a>, also allied with the USSR. PFLP has historically been the second largest group within the PLO, following <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatah\">Fatah</a> which was led by PLO Chairman <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yasser_Arafat\">Yasser Arafat</a>. </p><p>The PFLP has <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Popular_Front_For_The_Liberation_Of_Palestine\">separated from</a> the PLO and rejoined it on various occasions. A significant break occurred in 1993, when Arafat signed the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oslo_Accords\">Oslo Accords</a> with Israel. The Oslo Accords coincided with the fall of the USSR, prompting the PFLP to ally itself with Islamist regimes like Iran and groups like <a href=\"https://canarymission.org/organization/Hamas\">Hamas</a>, <a href=\"http://www.adl.org/israel-international/israel-middle-east/content/AG/palestinian-islamic-jihad.html#.WHwmR_l96Uk\">Palestinian Islamic Jihad</a> and <a href=\"http://www.cfr.org/lebanon/hezbollah-k-hizbollah-hizbullah/p9155\">Hezbollah</a> —  all of which reject Israel’s existence. The PFLP has not rejoined the PLO, although relations have thawed since the 2006 <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinian_Legislative_Council\">Palestinian Legislative Council (PLC)</a> elections when three PFLP members were <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Popular_Front_For_The_Liberation_Of_Palestine\">elected</a>.</p><h2>Contemporary Leaders and High-Profile Members</h2><p><b>Leila Khaled</b> - Born in 1944, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leila_Khaled\">Leila Khaled</a> is a <a href=\"http://pflp.ps/english/2016/02/02/leila-khaled-at-the-new-world-summit-palestinian-people-have-struggled-100-years-for-liberation/\">member</a> of the PFLP Political Bureau. Khaled participated in the hijacking of<a href=\"http://adst.org/2015/08/the-pflp-hijacking-of-twa-840/\"> TWA Flight 840</a> in 1969 and<a href=\"http://middleeast.about.com/od/terrorism/a/dawson-field-hijackings.htm\"> El Al Flight 219</a> in 1970. Following the 1969 hijacking, she<a href=\"http://www.thenational.ae/arts-culture/leila-khaled-the-1970s-palestinian-revolutionary-is-still-passionate\"> underwent</a> six plastic surgeries to conceal her identity in preparation for carrying out the 1970 hijacking. Khaled said the process “[b]eautified my mind.”</p><p>In a 2014 <a href=\"http://elderofziyon.blogspot.com/2014/04/mondoweiss-and-human-rights-activist.html#.U0P_D6hdWuK\">interview</a>, Khaled opined that the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnxOggdPWXg&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=69\">second Intifada</a> failed because it was not violent enough. Khaled is a <a href=\"http://pflp.ps/english/2016/02/02/leila-khaled-at-the-new-world-summit-palestinian-people-have-struggled-100-years-for-liberation/\">supporter</a> of the BDS movement and speaks at many pro-BDS events around the world.</p><p>Khaled is often presented as an icon of the Palestinian cause, celebrated in many <a href=\"https://www.google.com/search?q=leila+khaled&amp;biw=1366&amp;bih=667&amp;espv=2&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj7w7mnrI_PAhWJoRQKHQdCAzkQ_AUIBigB#imgrc=7_TD041LkUcxKM%3A\" >photos</a>, often <a href=\"https://www.google.com/search?q=leila+khaled&amp;biw=1366&amp;bih=667&amp;espv=2&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj7w7mnrI_PAhWJoRQKHQdCAzkQ_AUIBigB#imgrc=3EeepZT3ULyHqM%3A\" >holding</a> an AK-47 assault rifle. These images are <a href=\"https://canarymission.org/individual/Rawan_Toom\" >popular</a> with anti-Israel groups and are often incorporated in apparel. Khaled is also frequently <a href=\"http://mrzine.monthlyreview.org/2010/ks080310.html\" >invoked</a> as a female Palestinian role model.<br></p><p><b>Ahmad Sa’adat -</b> Born in 1953, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ahmad_Sa%27adat\">Ahmad Sa’adat</a> is the Secretary-General (SG) of the PFLP. Sa’adat is currently in Israeli prison for his role in organizing the assassination of Israeli Tourism Minister Rehavam Ze'evi. Sa’adat has held the position since October 2001. Sa’adat is also a member of the PLC.  </p><p>The Palestinian Authority (PA) imprisoned Sa’adat shortly after Ze’evi’s murder. This was following an agreement between Israel and the PA after Israel surrounded the PLO headquarters where Sa’adat sought refuge. In March 2006, Israel launched an operation on the PA jail where Sa’adat was held and brought him to Israel. He was tried in 2008 for his role in Ze’evi’s murder and has engaged in many hunger strikes during his time in Israeli prison.</p><p>The social media hashtag “#FreeAhmadSaadat” is a call for Sa’adat’s release.</p><p><b>Khalida Jarrar </b>- One of three PFLP members on the Palestinian Legislative Council (PLC), <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khalida_Jarrar\">Khalida Jarrar</a> was arrested in April 2015, on charges that included inciting violence and calling for terrorists to abduct Israel Defense Forces (IDF) soldiers. Jarrar was eventually <a href=\"http://www.timesofisrael.com/palestinian-lawmaker-given-15-months-for-inciting-terror/\">sentenced</a> to 15 months in jail as part of a plea deal, when she confessed to all of the charges leveled against her. She was <a href=\"http://www.timesofisrael.com/israel-to-release-palestinian-mp-after-14-months-in-prison/\">released</a> early, in June of 2016.</p><p>The social media hashtag “#FreeKhalida” was a call for Jarrar’s release.</p><h2>Important Historic Leaders</h2><p><b>Ghassan Kanafani </b>- Chief writer, propagandist and spokesman for the PFLP in its early years, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghassan_Kanafani\">Ghassan Kanafani</a> (1936 - 1972) was known as one of of the most influential Palestinian thinkers and authors. He remains a popular figure and is quoted frequently. Among his most famous <a href=\"http://www.azquotes.com/author/19050-Ghassan_Kanafani\">quotes</a> is the sentence: “We write with the blood for Palestine.”</p><p>Kanafani was born in Akko (Acre) and fled during the fighting of the Israeli War of Independence, eventually reaching Damascus, Syria. Kanafani met George Habash, founder of the PFLP, in 1953 and maintained a close connection with Habash despite moving across different countries in the Middle East for several years.</p><p>Kanafani was an Arab Nationalist until 1967 when he joined the PFLP and ran the group’s weekly magazine al-Hadaf (The Target). He helped <a href=\"http://www.haaretz.com/with-thanks-to-ghassan-kanafani-1.155993\">plan</a> the 1972 Lod Airport Massacre and Israel killed him later that year.&nbsp;</p><p><b>George Habash -</b> The founder of the PFLP, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Habash\" >George Habash</a> (1926 - 2008) was <a href=\"http://content.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,1707366,00.html\" >known</a> as the “godfather” of terrorism for his role in pioneering airplane hijackings — including the September 1970 hijackings of four airplanes in a single day. Habash served as the PFLP Secretary General from the group’s founding in 1967, until 2000. Habash suffered a stroke in 1980 and died in 2008, of a heart attack, while living in Jordan. Habash went by the <i>nom de guerre</i> “Al Hakim.”</p><p>Habash was born to a Greek Orthodox Christian family, in Lod (Lydda) and fled to Lebanon with his family during the fighting of the Israeli War of Independence. Habash received a doctorate in medicine from the American University in Beirut, in 1951.</p>",

The hijackers were members of a splinter group within the PFLP who flew the plane to Entebbe, Uganda, where they <a href=\"https://youtu.be/W3LTfZ1CZ1g?t=808\">separated</a> nearly 100 Jewish passengers from the others — and threatened to execute one per hour. Israel, however, launched a successful commando raid to rescue the hostages. </p><p>The PFLP also <a href=\"http://middleeast.about.com/od/terrorism/a/dawson-field-hijackings.htm\">carried</a> out the September 6, 1970 hijacking of four airliners taking off from New York, Brussels, Zurich and Frankfurt. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leila_Khaled\">Leila Khaled</a> took part in the operation. The incident concluded with three of the airplanes being blown up in Jordan, in front of international media cameras, after crew and passengers disembarked.</p><h2>Targeting Civilians </h2><p>The PFLP has attacked chiefly civilian targets, including the 1969 SuperSol supermarket bombing in Jerusalem that killed two foreign students. The bombing was masterminded and carried out by <a href=\"http://legalinsurrection.com/2015/09/the-sickening-deification-of-rasmea-odeh/\">Rasmea Odeh</a>, who has been elevated to iconic stature within anti-Israel groups like SJP and BDS. Odeh and the PFLP attempted to bomb the British consulate four days after the SuperSol bombing.</p><p>The PFLP <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/middle-east/jerusalem-synagogue-attack-popular-front-for-the-liberation-of-palestine-claims-responsibility-9868981.html\">claimed</a> “credit” for the 2001 <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2001/oct/17/israel2\">assassination </a>of Israeli Tourism Minister Rehavam Ze'evi and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Palestinian_suicide_attacks\">perpetrated</a> many suicide bombings against Israeli civilians during the second Intifada. These included the 2004 <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carmel_Market_bombing\">Carmel Market Bombing</a> in Tel Aviv —  where a 16-year-old PFLP terrorist murdered three Israelis and injured 30 more — and the 2002 <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karnei_Shomron_Mall_suicide_bombing\">Karnei Shomron suicide bombing</a>, which left three teenage Israeli girls dead  and injured 27 people. The suicide bomber detonated his bomb in the doorway of a pizza parlor. </p><p>In recent years, PFLP members carried out the March 2011 <a href=\"http://mfa.gov.il/MFA/ForeignPolicy/Terrorism/Palestinian/Pages/Two_Fogel_family_murderers_arrested_17-Apr-2011.aspx\">butchering</a> of five members of the Fogel Family — father Udi, mother Ruth, and eleven-year-old Yoav, four-year-old Elad and three-month-old infant Hadas. </p><p>PFLP members also <a href=\"http://jonathanhalevi.blogspot.com/2014/11/canadian-palestinian-samidoun.html\">carried</a> out the November 2014 Har Nof Massacre, where <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/middle-east/jerusalem-synagogue-attack-popular-front-for-the-liberation-of-palestine-claims-responsibility-9868981.html\">two terrorists</a> used a gun, axes and <a href=\"https://youtu.be/nGcvox0K_Tg?t=43\">butcher knife</a> to murder five Jewish <a href=\"http://mfa.gov.il/MFA/ForeignPolicy/Terrorism/Palestinian/Pages/Terror-attack-in-Jerusalem-synagogue-18-Nov-2014.aspx\">rabbis</a> during <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/19/world/middleeast/killings-in-jerusalem-synagogue-complex.html?_r=0\">morning prayers</a> in a Jerusalem synagogue. The attackers also killed a Druze police officer in the ensuing gunfight, before the terrorists were killed. PFLP Gaza leader, Hani Thawbta, <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/11/18/attack-on-jerusalem-synagogue_n_6175726.html\">stated</a>: “We declare full responsibility of the PFLP for the execution of this heroic operation...\"</p><h2>Background </h2><p>Since its <a href=\"http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/para/pflp.htm\">founding </a>in December 1967, until the fall of the Soviet Union (USSR) in 1991, the PFLP relied heavily upon funding from the major powers in the Communist bloc, namely the USSR and China. PFLP leader Wadie Haddad was later <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wadie_Haddad\">revealed</a> to be Soviet KGB agent. </p><p>In 1968, the PFLP joined the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestine_Liberation_Organization\">Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO)</a>, also allied with the USSR. PFLP has historically been the second largest group within the PLO, following <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatah\">Fatah</a> which was led by PLO Chairman <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yasser_Arafat\">Yasser Arafat</a>. </p><p>The PFLP has <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Popular_Front_For_The_Liberation_Of_Palestine\">separated from</a> the PLO and rejoined it on various occasions. A significant break occurred in 1993, when Arafat signed the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oslo_Accords\">Oslo Accords</a> with Israel. The Oslo Accords coincided with the fall of the USSR, prompting the PFLP to ally itself with Islamist regimes like Iran and groups like <a href=\"https://canarymission.org/organization/Hamas\">Hamas</a>, <a href=\"http://www.adl.org/israel-international/israel-middle-east/content/AG/palestinian-islamic-jihad.html#.WHwmR_l96Uk\">Palestinian Islamic Jihad</a> and <a href=\"http://www.cfr.org/lebanon/hezbollah-k-hizbollah-hizbullah/p9155\">Hezbollah</a> —  all of which reject Israel’s existence. The PFLP has not rejoined the PLO, although relations have thawed since the 2006 <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinian_Legislative_Council\">Palestinian Legislative Council (PLC)</a> elections when three PFLP members were <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Popular_Front_For_The_Liberation_Of_Palestine\">elected</a>.</p><h2>Contemporary Leaders and High-Profile Members</h2><p><b>Leila Khaled</b> - Born in 1944, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leila_Khaled\">Leila Khaled</a> is a <a href=\"http://pflp.ps/english/2016/02/02/leila-khaled-at-the-new-world-summit-palestinian-people-have-struggled-100-years-for-liberation/\">member</a> of the PFLP Political Bureau. Khaled participated in the hijacking of<a href=\"http://adst.org/2015/08/the-pflp-hijacking-of-twa-840/\"> TWA Flight 840</a> in 1969 and<a href=\"http://middleeast.about.com/od/terrorism/a/dawson-field-hijackings.htm\"> El Al Flight 219</a> in 1970. Following the 1969 hijacking, she<a href=\"http://www.thenational.ae/arts-culture/leila-khaled-the-1970s-palestinian-revolutionary-is-still-passionate\"> underwent</a> six plastic surgeries to conceal her identity in preparation for carrying out the 1970 hijacking. Khaled said the process “[b]eautified my mind.”</p><p>In a 2014 <a href=\"http://elderofziyon.blogspot.com/2014/04/mondoweiss-and-human-rights-activist.html#.U0P_D6hdWuK\">interview</a>, Khaled opined that the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnxOggdPWXg&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=69\">second Intifada</a> failed because it was not violent enough. Khaled is a <a href=\"http://pflp.ps/english/2016/02/02/leila-khaled-at-the-new-world-summit-palestinian-people-have-struggled-100-years-for-liberation/\">supporter</a> of the BDS movement and speaks at many pro-BDS events around the world.</p><p>Khaled is often presented as an icon of the Palestinian cause, celebrated in many <a href=\"https://www.google.com/search?q=leila+khaled&amp;biw=1366&amp;bih=667&amp;espv=2&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj7w7mnrI_PAhWJoRQKHQdCAzkQ_AUIBigB#imgrc=7_TD041LkUcxKM%3A\" >photos</a>, often <a href=\"https://www.google.com/search?q=leila+khaled&amp;biw=1366&amp;bih=667&amp;espv=2&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj7w7mnrI_PAhWJoRQKHQdCAzkQ_AUIBigB#imgrc=3EeepZT3ULyHqM%3A\" >holding</a> an AK-47 assault rifle.

Khaled is also frequently <a href=\"http://mrzine.monthlyreview.org/2010/ks080310.html\" >invoked</a> as a female Palestinian role model.<br></p><p><b>Ahmad Sa’adat -</b> Born in 1953, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ahmad_Sa%27adat\">Ahmad Sa’adat</a> is the Secretary-General (SG) of the PFLP. Sa’adat is currently in Israeli prison for his role in organizing the assassination of Israeli Tourism Minister Rehavam Ze'evi. Sa’adat has held the position since October 2001. Sa’adat is also a member of the PLC.  </p><p>The Palestinian Authority (PA) imprisoned Sa’adat shortly after Ze’evi’s murder. This was following an agreement between Israel and the PA after Israel surrounded the PLO headquarters where Sa’adat sought refuge. In March 2006, Israel launched an operation on the PA jail where Sa’adat was held and brought him to Israel. He was tried in 2008 for his role in Ze’evi’s murder and has engaged in many hunger strikes during his time in Israeli prison.</p><p>The social media hashtag “#FreeAhmadSaadat” is a call for Sa’adat’s release.</p><p><b>Khalida Jarrar </b>- One of three PFLP members on the Palestinian Legislative Council (PLC), <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khalida_Jarrar\">Khalida Jarrar</a> was arrested in April 2015, on charges that included inciting violence and calling for terrorists to abduct Israel Defense Forces (IDF) soldiers. Jarrar was eventually <a href=\"http://www.timesofisrael.com/palestinian-lawmaker-given-15-months-for-inciting-terror/\">sentenced</a> to 15 months in jail as part of a plea deal, when she confessed to all of the charges leveled against her. She was <a href=\"http://www.timesofisrael.com/israel-to-release-palestinian-mp-after-14-months-in-prison/\">released</a> early, in June of 2016.</p><p>The social media hashtag “#FreeKhalida” was a call for Jarrar’s release.</p><h2>Important Historic Leaders</h2><p><b>Ghassan Kanafani </b>- Chief writer, propagandist and spokesman for the PFLP in its early years, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghassan_Kanafani\">Ghassan Kanafani</a> (1936 - 1972) was known as one of of the most influential Palestinian thinkers and authors. He remains a popular figure and is quoted frequently. Among his most famous <a href=\"http://www.azquotes.com/author/19050-Ghassan_Kanafani\">quotes</a> is the sentence: “We write with the blood for Palestine.”</p><p>Kanafani was born in Akko (Acre) and fled during the fighting of the Israeli War of Independence, eventually reaching Damascus, Syria. Kanafani met George Habash, founder of the PFLP, in 1953 and maintained a close connection with Habash despite moving across different countries in the Middle East for several years.</p><p>Kanafani was an Arab Nationalist until 1967 when he joined the PFLP and ran the group’s weekly magazine al-Hadaf (The Target). He helped <a href=\"http://www.haaretz.com/with-thanks-to-ghassan-kanafani-1.155993\">plan</a> the 1972 Lod Airport Massacre and Israel killed him later that year.&nbsp;</p><p><b>George Habash -</b> The founder of the PFLP, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Habash\" >George Habash</a> (1926 - 2008) was <a href=\"http://content.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,1707366,00.html\" >known</a> as the “godfather” of terrorism for his role in pioneering airplane hijackings — including the September 1970 hijackings of four airplanes in a single day. Habash served as the PFLP Secretary General from the group’s founding in 1967, until 2000. Habash suffered a stroke in 1980 and died in 2008, of a heart attack, while living in Jordan. Habash went by the <i>nom de guerre</i> “Al Hakim.”</p><p>Habash was born to a Greek Orthodox Christian family, in Lod (Lydda) and fled to Lebanon with his family during the fighting of the Israeli War of Independence. Habash received a doctorate in medicine from the American University in Beirut, in 1951.</p>",

Then, three individuals grabbed Prof. Pedahzur’s arm and <a href=\"https://youtu.be/46W4S3lr9HU?t=5m23s\">pushed him</a> backwards. Eventually, the campus police arrived and detained the PSC members.</p><p>Following the incident, PSC released a <a href=\"https://youtu.be/46W4S3lr9HU\">heavily edited video</a> of the protest, falsely accusing Prof. Pedahzur of assault, and lodged a <a href=\"http://legalinsurrection.com/2015/11/did-ut-austin-students-who-disrupted-israel-studies-event-violate-campus-code/\">“civil rights” complaint</a> with the University.

Long Live the Intifada!”<br><br><b>Defending a Terrorist</b><br><br>In November of 2016, PSC Harvard <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/psc.harvard/posts/1281137465261683\">hosted </a>an event defending<a href=\"https://twitter.com/saiayork/status/402278948026851328\"> </a><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rasmea_Odeh\">Rasmea Odeh</a>.

In 1969, Odeh masterminded a <a href=\"http://www.jta.org/1969/02/24/archive/jerusalem-supersol-re-opens-for-business-2-young-bombing-victims-are-buried\">bombing</a> that killed two university students in a Jerusalem supermarket, and attempted to bomb the British consulate. </p><p>Odeh confessed, in a highly detailed <a href=\"https://www.scribd.com/document/288292022/Rasmieh-Odeh-Case-March-1-and-7-1969-Ramieh-Confessions-Exh-I-to-Govt-Response-to-Motion-for-Reconsideration-of-Bond-Revocation\">account</a>, the day following her arrest. In a 2004 documentary, one of Odeh’s co-conspirators <a href=\"https://youtu.be/kfGhHu6VYlE?t=44\">directly implicated</a> her as the mastermind. </p><p><b>Supporting Incitement</b><br><br>In April 2015, PSC Harvard held an event called “Being Palestinian in a Jewish State,” <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.895742033801230.1073741828.148819558493485&amp;type=3\">featuring</a>  Haneen Zoabi —a member of Israel’s parliament (the Knesset). Zoabi who has been investigated for <a href=\"http://www.israelhayom.com/site/newsletter_opinion.php?id=13975\">inciting violence</a> on a <a href=\"http://www.jpost.com/Diplomacy-and-Politics/Haneen-Zoabi-suspended-from-Knesset-over-Gaza-flotilla\">number of occasions</a>. </p><p>In July 2014, Zoabi was suspended from the Knesset, after she <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haneen_Zoabi#2014_kidnapping_comments_and_Knesset_suspension\">attempted to justify </a>the <a href=\"https://www.rt.com/news/181940-hamas-israel-kidnapping-teenagers/\">Hamas terrorists</a> who kidnapped three Israeli high-schoolers from a bus stop, declaring  that the abductors were \"not terrorists.\" The boys were later found to have been <a href=\"https://www.rt.com/news/181940-hamas-israel-kidnapping-teenagers/\">murdered</a> by their kidnappers. <br></p><h2>PSC UT Austin</h2><p><b>Promoting Disruption <br></b><br>On November 13, 2015, PSC UT Austin was involved in <a href=\"http://legalinsurrection.com/2015/11/anti-israel-students-target-ut-austin-israeli-studies-prof-after-disrupting-his-speech/\">hijacking</a> an event organized by Professor Ami Pedahzur of the Institute for Israeli Studies on UT Austin’s campus. The scheduled guest speaker was Dr. Gil-Li Vardi of Stanford University, who was to deliver a lecture on the birth of the Israeli Defense Forces’ military culture.</p><p>PSC members formed a human wall at the back of the room, unfurled a large Palestinian Flag, while their leader, <a href=\"https://canarymission.org/individual/Mohammed_Nabulsi\">Mohammed Nabulsi</a>, read a prepared speech on “the ethnic cleansing of the indigenous population of Palestine.” Professor Pedahzur asked the group to listen to scheduled speaker and then respond, but they refused all dialogue. Instead, the students screamed: “We don’t want two states,” and  “Long Live the Intifada!!” conveying their support for the <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/videos/world/2015/10/14/israel-attack-surveillance-footage-jerusalem-orig.israeli-police\">\"knife Intifada,\"</a> then occurring throughout Israel.</p><p>Professor Pedhazur faced down the ranting disruptors. Then, three individuals grabbed Prof. Pedahzur’s arm and <a href=\"https://youtu.be/46W4S3lr9HU?t=5m23s\">pushed him</a> backwards. Eventually, the campus police arrived and detained the PSC members.</p><p>Following the incident, PSC released a <a href=\"https://youtu.be/46W4S3lr9HU\">heavily edited video</a> of the protest, falsely accusing Prof. Pedahzur of assault, and lodged a <a href=\"http://legalinsurrection.com/2015/11/did-ut-austin-students-who-disrupted-israel-studies-event-violate-campus-code/\">“civil rights” complaint</a> with the University. PSC Finance Committee Chair, Ahmed Khawaja, subsequently initiated a GoFundMe <a href=\"https://www.gofundme.com/73ax6tng\">fundraising campaign</a> in order to sue Professor Pedahzur.<br><br><b>Anti-American Sentiment</b><br><br>In November of 2015, PSC UT Austin <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/events/563524427145086/\">posted </a>a call to protest a talk by U.S. Navy veteran Admiral William McRaven, a UT Austin graduate,who led the raid to kill Osama bin Laden. PSC accused UT Austin of hosting “a swarm of US intelligence and military officials on campus” who would “recruit students to a life of crime.”  <br><br>For additional history about SJP, an <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Students_for_Justice_in_Palestine\">alternative name</a> for PSC, see<a href=\"https://canarymission.org/organization/Students_For_Justice_In_Palestine\"> SJP</a>.</p>",

In 2014, York <a href=\"http://www.excal.on.ca/the-end-of-saia/\">suspended </a>SAIA York’s charter for one year, due to the group’s repeated disruptions of academic activities.</p><p>Below is a summary of these two SAIA chapters’ activities.</p><h2>SAIA York </h2><p><b>Demonizing Israel</b><br><br>On February 5, 2015, soon after their one year suspension ended, SAIA York was back on campus, running <a href=\"https://youtu.be/LI6cPfR9s3o?t=28m6s\">anti-Israel</a> programs and spreading propaganda that demonized Israel. SAIA York ran a program featuring <a href=\"https://canarymission.org/individual/Hammam_Farah\">Hammam Farah</a>, an SAIA agitator, since 2003, who accused “zionist militias” of ethnic cleansing, <a href=\"https://youtu.be/LI6cPfR9s3o?t=1801\">mutilating women</a>, of putting Palestinians on a death march and of <a href=\"https://youtu.be/LI6cPfR9s3o?t=1935\">murdering</a> the elderly and disabled. </p><p>As of January 2017, SAIA York has <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/hammam.farah/videos/vb.48907473/10103562674119790/?type=2&amp;theater\">continued </a>to feature Farah on its Facebook page.<br><br><b>Endorsing Terrorists<br></b><br>In November of 2012, SAIA York <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/SAIA.York/posts/411442928927655\">screened </a>a film promoting <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leila_Khaled\">Leila Khaled</a>, a <a href=\"http://www.ibtimes.com/what-popular-front-liberation-palestine-what-know-about-organization-behind-jerusalem-1725550\">Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP)</a> terrorist, who hijacked two passenger airplanes in 1969 and 1970 — and as of April 3, 2014, still <a href=\"http://mondoweiss.net/2014/04/palestine-paradise-interview/\">advocated violence </a>to achieve her ends. In November of 2013, SAIA York also <a href=\"https://twitter.com/saiayork/status/402278948026851328\">defended </a>convicted terrorist <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rasmea_Odeh\">Rasmea Odeh</a>. </p><p>Odeh was a key <a href=\"http://legalinsurrection.com/2014/11/rasmea-odeh-rightly-convicted-of-israeli-supermarket-bombing-and-u-s-immigration-fraud/\">military operative </a>with the <a href=\"http://www.ibtimes.com/what-popular-front-liberation-palestine-what-know-about-organization-behind-jerusalem-1725550\">PFLP, a designated terrorist organization according to the United States, Canada, the European Union and Israel.</a> </p><p>In 1969, the PFLP bombed a Jerusalem supermarket, killing two college students and attempted to bomb the Jerusalem British consulate.

The speech. <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/notes/hammam-farah/york-u-demo-speeches/2226414679\">Transcripts</a> and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jx1t0bpJmdI\">video</a>, posted on YouTube and the Facebook and Twitter pages of SAIA members, were punctuated with calls of: “Intifada, Intifada!” and “Amandla [Power to]! INTIFADA! Amandla! AL AWDA [Right of Return]!” <a href=\"http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/intifada\">Intifada </a>refers to a violent armed uprising against Israelis. <br><br> In 2008, another <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-C7zpX2SxQ\">demonstration </a>calling for an Intifada was held by SAIA York. </p><h2>SAIA GMU </h2><p><b>Promoting Hatred of Israel</b></p><p>In early November of 2016, SAIA GMU <a href=\"http://www.nationalsjp.org/updates/announcing-the-2016-national-sjp-conference-at-george-mason-university\">hosted </a>the sixth annual National SJP conference.  During the conference, T-shirts <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/SJP.National/photos/a.1260085574029403.1073741833.255077141196923/1260088520695775/?type=3&amp;theater\">promoting </a>terrorist Leila Khaled were sold, An Israeli flag was <a href=\"https://www.algemeiner.com/2016/11/09/israel-advocate-bemoans-lack-of-jewish-establishment-participation-in-peaceful-protest-against-annual-anti-zionist-conference-at-george-mason-u/\">reportedly </a>used a doormat — and a conference attendee tweeted a photo of shoes piled atop the flag, with the caption, “Best doormat ever.”</p><p>Conference attendees <a href=\"http://www.tabletmag.com/scroll/217308/israeli-and-palestinian-activists-go-head-to-head-at-sjp-event-at-george-mason-university\">reportedly </a>spread number of outwardly violent messages across social media. One attendee, for example, after discovering that pro-Israel activists were also on site, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/reemzaitoon_/status/794927110964047872\">tweeted</a>, “I’ll f**k up a Zionist.”<br></p><p>On September 30, 2016, SAIA GMU <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/GMUSAIA/posts/1102253833195485\">recycled</a> on Facebook an <a href=\"http://aldurah.com/icon-of-hatred/\">iconic</a> piece of anti-Israel incitement, dubbed the <a href=\"http://www.meforum.org/3076/muhammad-al-dura-hoax\">Al Durah hoax</a>  — which was <a href=\"https://vimeo.com/67054759\">fabricated</a> during a riot in the Gaza Strip, at the start of the second intifada. A <a href=\"http://aldurah.com/the-al-durah-incident/the-evidence/\">France 2 report</a> — filmed by a <a href=\"http://aldurah.com/we-have-some-secrets-you-know-for-our-self-talal-abu-rahma-interviewed-by-esther-schapira/\">Palestinian cameraman</a> and narrated by France 2's editor, who was not at the scene — purported to show Jamal al-Durah and his 12-year-old son, Muhammad, crouching behind a concrete cylinder, shot by Israeli forces. The minute-long film clip showed the boy crying and the father waving. Following what sounded like a burst of gunfire, the video showed the boy slumped across his father's legs. <br><br>Subsequent <a href=\"https://youtu.be/DzsCBFhCsyY?t=10\">review</a> of the raw footage revealed that France 2 had edited out the <a href=\"http://aldurah.com/the-al-durah-incident/the-evidence/a-closer-look-at-france2-raw-al-durah-footage/\">final scenes</a> captured by the Palestinian cameraman — which showed the boy peeking at the camera from beneath his raised arm. Film of the father and son from other news networks — indicating that the entire scene was staged — was also uncovered. The physical evidence also <a href=\"http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2003/06/who-shot-mohammed-al-dura/302735/\">showed </a>it highly likely that the gunfire directed at the pair came from Palestinian gunmen situated behind the France 2 cameraman — and was in all ways inconsistent with shots coming from the IDF position.<br><br><b>Portraying Terrorists as Victims</b></p><p>On October 3, 2015, SAIA GMU <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/GMUSAIA/posts/883991551688382\">shared</a> a video of Palestinian terrorist <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/oct/04/binyamin-netanyahu-promises-harsh-offensive-palestinian\">Fadi Aloon</a> on Facebook from a blog written by the anti-Israel hate site <a href=\"https://canarymission.org/organization/Electronic_Intifada\">Electronic Intifada</a>. The blog title claimed that Aloon was “executed.” In truth, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/oct/04/binyamin-netanyahu-promises-harsh-offensive-palestinian\">Aloon</a> was shot by Israeli security forces after Aloon <a href=\"http://www.timesofisrael.com/israeli-teen-stabbed-outside-jerusalems-old-city/\">stabbed</a> a 15-year old Israeli boy. Several hours before his attempt at murder, Aloon <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/oct/04/binyamin-netanyahu-promises-harsh-offensive-palestinian\">posted</a> “Either martyrdom or victory” on his Facebook page. <br><br>October 2015 saw a wave of <a href=\"https://youtu.be/Xii-97MU6SQ?t=207\">religiously incited</a> terrorist violence, known variously as the “<a href=\"http://mosaicmagazine.com/observation/2016/03/what-palestinians-think-about-the-knife-intifada/\">Knife Intifada</a>” or the “<a href=\"http://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2015/10/the-roots-of-the-palestinian-uprising-against-israel/410944/\">Stabbing Intifada</a>” when Palestinian radicals across Israel <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xz-bXKOqDqQ\">stabbed</a> and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GUbCQPDDu_8\">hacked</a> to death scores of <a href=\"http://mfa.gov.il/MFA/ForeignPolicy/Terrorism/Palestinian/Pages/Wave-of-terror-October-2015.aspx\">Israeli civilians</a>. The attacks were sparked and fueled by Palestinian leaders propagating the <a href=\"http://jcpa.org/al-aksa-is-in-danger-libel/\">libel</a> that Israel intended to desecrate the Al Aqsa Mosque in Jerusalem. That same claim <a href=\"http://foreignpolicyblogs.com/2014/11/21/palestinian-incitement-behind-synagogue-terror-attack/\">led directly</a> to deadly <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2014_Jerusalem_synagogue_attack\">anti-Semitic violence</a> in 2014.</p><p><b>Shutting down Dialogue</b><br><br>In June of 2013, SAIA GMU members <a href=\"http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2013/06/04/olmert-heckled-again-this-time-from-the-left.html\">interrupted </a>a speech given by former Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert at the Wilson Center in Washington D.C.</p><p>The students <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=847zKQg0wTo\">screamed</a> insults and accusations at Olmert, calling out “War Criminal” and “Murderer.” One individual <a href=\"https://youtu.be/847zKQg0wTo?t=121\">accused</a> Israeli soldiers of “playing soccer with the head of a dead two-year-old.”</p><p>SAIA’s repeated interruptions forced the Wilson Center Director, Jane Harman, to call for a tightening of security. Harman later commented: “I also defend free speech in this country...but it is unfortunate that people feel the need to disrupt a gathering where they could peacefully and civilly ask questions.”<br><br>For more information about the history of SJP, an <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Students_for_Justice_in_Palestine\">alternative name</a> for SAIA, see<a href=\"https://canarymission.org/organization/Students_For_Justice_In_Palestine\"> SJP</a>.<br></p>",

INTIFADA! Amandla! AL AWDA [Right of Return]!” <a href=\"http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/intifada\">Intifada </a>refers to a violent armed uprising against Israelis. <br><br> In 2008, another <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-C7zpX2SxQ\">demonstration </a>calling for an Intifada was held by SAIA York. </p><h2>SAIA GMU </h2><p><b>Promoting Hatred of Israel</b></p><p>In early November of 2016, SAIA GMU <a href=\"http://www.nationalsjp.org/updates/announcing-the-2016-national-sjp-conference-at-george-mason-university\">hosted </a>the sixth annual National SJP conference.

One attendee, for example, after discovering that pro-Israel activists were also on site, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/reemzaitoon_/status/794927110964047872\">tweeted</a>, “I’ll f**k up a Zionist.”<br></p><p>On September 30, 2016, SAIA GMU <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/GMUSAIA/posts/1102253833195485\">recycled</a> on Facebook an <a href=\"http://aldurah.com/icon-of-hatred/\">iconic</a> piece of anti-Israel incitement, dubbed the <a href=\"http://www.meforum.org/3076/muhammad-al-dura-hoax\">Al Durah hoax</a>  — which was <a href=\"https://vimeo.com/67054759\">fabricated</a> during a riot in the Gaza Strip, at the start of the second intifada. A <a href=\"http://aldurah.com/the-al-durah-incident/the-evidence/\">France 2 report</a> — filmed by a <a href=\"http://aldurah.com/we-have-some-secrets-you-know-for-our-self-talal-abu-rahma-interviewed-by-esther-schapira/\">Palestinian cameraman</a> and narrated by France 2's editor, who was not at the scene — purported to show Jamal al-Durah and his 12-year-old son, Muhammad, crouching behind a concrete cylinder, shot by Israeli forces. The minute-long film clip showed the boy crying and the father waving. Following what sounded like a burst of gunfire, the video showed the boy slumped across his father's legs. <br><br>Subsequent <a href=\"https://youtu.be/DzsCBFhCsyY?t=10\">review</a> of the raw footage revealed that France 2 had edited out the <a href=\"http://aldurah.com/the-al-durah-incident/the-evidence/a-closer-look-at-france2-raw-al-durah-footage/\">final scenes</a> captured by the Palestinian cameraman — which showed the boy peeking at the camera from beneath his raised arm. Film of the father and son from other news networks — indicating that the entire scene was staged — was also uncovered. The physical evidence also <a href=\"http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2003/06/who-shot-mohammed-al-dura/302735/\">showed </a>it highly likely that the gunfire directed at the pair came from Palestinian gunmen situated behind the France 2 cameraman — and was in all ways inconsistent with shots coming from the IDF position.<br><br><b>Portraying Terrorists as Victims</b></p><p>On October 3, 2015, SAIA GMU <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/GMUSAIA/posts/883991551688382\">shared</a> a video of Palestinian terrorist <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/oct/04/binyamin-netanyahu-promises-harsh-offensive-palestinian\">Fadi Aloon</a> on Facebook from a blog written by the anti-Israel hate site <a href=\"https://canarymission.org/organization/Electronic_Intifada\">Electronic Intifada</a>. The blog title claimed that Aloon was “executed.” In truth, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/oct/04/binyamin-netanyahu-promises-harsh-offensive-palestinian\">Aloon</a> was shot by Israeli security forces after Aloon <a href=\"http://www.timesofisrael.com/israeli-teen-stabbed-outside-jerusalems-old-city/\">stabbed</a> a 15-year old Israeli boy.

The attacks were sparked and fueled by Palestinian leaders propagating the <a href=\"http://jcpa.org/al-aksa-is-in-danger-libel/\">libel</a> that Israel intended to desecrate the Al Aqsa Mosque in Jerusalem. That same claim <a href=\"http://foreignpolicyblogs.com/2014/11/21/palestinian-incitement-behind-synagogue-terror-attack/\">led directly</a> to deadly <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2014_Jerusalem_synagogue_attack\">anti-Semitic violence</a> in 2014.</p><p><b>Shutting down Dialogue</b><br><br>In June of 2013, SAIA GMU members <a href=\"http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2013/06/04/olmert-heckled-again-this-time-from-the-left.html\">interrupted </a>a speech given by former Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert at the Wilson Center in Washington D.C.</p><p>The students <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=847zKQg0wTo\">screamed</a> insults and accusations at Olmert, calling out “War Criminal” and “Murderer.” One individual <a href=\"https://youtu.be/847zKQg0wTo?t=121\">accused</a> Israeli soldiers of “playing soccer with the head of a dead two-year-old.”</p><p>SAIA’s repeated interruptions forced the Wilson Center Director, Jane Harman, to call for a tightening of security.

In 1969, she masterminded a <a href=\"http://www.jta.org/1969/02/24/archive/jerusalem-supersol-re-opens-for-business-2-young-bombing-victims-are-buried\">bombing</a> that killed two university students in a Jerusalem supermarket. Odeh also attempted to bomb the British consulate.</p><p>Odeh confessed, in a highly detailed <a href=\"https://www.scribd.com/document/288292022/Rasmieh-Odeh-Case-March-1-and-7-1969-Ramieh-Confessions-Exh-I-to-Govt-Response-to-Motion-for-Reconsideration-of-Bond-Revocation\">account</a>, the day following her arrest. In a 2004 documentary, one of Odeh’s co-conspirators <a href=\"https://youtu.be/kfGhHu6VYlE?t=44\">directly implicated</a> her as the mastermind. </p><p>In 1970, an Israeli court tried and convicted Odeh for her involvement in both bombings and sentenced her to life imprisonment. However, Odeh was released 10 years later, in a prisoner swap and emigrated to the United States.</p><p>On February 27, 2016, SUPER PSU <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/events/508601476009375/\">hosted</a> a Palestinian Cultural Night, featuring multiple visual displays that <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/PSUSUPER/photos/a.1027863777252566.1073741832.252848371420781/1027872360585041/?type=3&amp;theater\">honored</a> terrorists, like <a href=\"http://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-30099510\">Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP)</a> members <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leila_Khaled\">Leila Khaled</a> and Rasmea Odeh.</p><p>Leila Khaled was a leading member of the <a href=\"http://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-30099510\">Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP)</a> and participated in the hijacking of<a href=\"http://adst.org/2015/08/the-pflp-hijacking-of-twa-840/\"> TWA Flight 840</a> in 1969 and<a href=\"http://middleeast.about.com/od/terrorism/a/dawson-field-hijackings.htm\"> El Al Flight 219</a> in 1970.</p><p>In a 2014 <a href=\"http://elderofziyon.blogspot.com/2014/04/mondoweiss-and-human-rights-activist.html#.U0P_D6hdWuK\">interview</a>, Khaled opined that the Palestinian <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnxOggdPWXg&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=69\">second intifada </a>failed because it was not violent enough. </p><p>As of 2016, Khaled remained a <a href=\"http://pflp.ps/english/2016/02/02/leila-khaled-at-the-new-world-summit-palestinian-people-have-struggled-100-years-for-liberation/\">member</a> of PFLP's Political Bureau.

The attack killed 26 people.<br></p><p></p><p>The scholarship was offered by the <a href=\"http://www.pal-youth.org/category/branches/usa/\">Palestinian Youth Movement (PYM USA)</a>. PYM’s website <a href=\"http://www.pal-youth.org/the-road-to-liberation-30-11-2012/\">states</a> “Our liberation...will be gained with the path that was written with the blood of our martyrs. We reaffirm that the only path that we are concerned with is the path that explicitly heads towards the liberation of our land and the return of our people to Palestine… All Palestine.” </p><p>On June 30, 2015, SUPER UW <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/SuperUw/posts/926635400732356\">encouraged</a> students to “please take action” and sign a petition calling on Israel to free Khader Adnan, who was in his 54th day of a hunger strike at the time.</p><p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khader_Adnan\">Khader Adnan</a> is a senior member of the terrorist organization Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ). PIJ “is dedicated to the violent destruction of Israel,” and has no ‘political wing’ or ‘social wing’, only a ‘military wing’ that focuses solely on promoting terrorism and the murder of Israelis. It is <a href=\"http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/world/islamic-jihad-prisoner-khader-adnan-ends-hunger-strike/story-e6frg6so-1226278714609\">reported</a> that the group is backed by Iran and has killed dozens of Israelis in suicide bombings and other attacks.</p><p>A 2007 YouTube <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtPQ4EqePqw\">video</a> showed Adnan praising and encouraging suicide bombings: \"Who among you will carry the next explosive belt? Who among you will fire the next bullets? Who among you will have his body parts blown all over?”</p><p></p><p><b>Promoting Incitement</b></p>On October 13, 2016, SUPER UW <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/SuperUw/posts/1231127020283191\">shared </a>an <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/SuperUw/posts/1231127020283191\">article </a>on Facebook that accused Israel of arresting Palestinian Astrophysicist and Professor at Al Quds University Imad Barghouthi for getting “likes and shares on facebook,” trivializing the effects of Barghouthi’s incitement. The article was published by the anti-Israel website <a href=\"https://electronicintifada.net/\">Electronic Intifada</a>.<p></p><p>Barghouti is a vocal <a href=\"http://www.memri.org/tv/palestinian-astrophysics-professor-imad-barghouthi-urges-development-missiles-archival\">supporter </a>of Hamas’s military wing the Izz ad-Din al-Qassam Brigades and has called for killing and being killed in the name of Islam.</p><p></p><p>A <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/memri.org/videos/10154190511739717/\">video</a>, published on October 22, 2014, showed Barghouthi, at an Al-Quds university <a href=\"https://canarymission.org/organization/Hamas\">Hamas</a> rally, draped in a Hamas banner, calling upon students to design weapons. He urged students to devote themselves to designing precision guided missiles and sniper rifles to target “zionist soldiers” and “to hunt them down in their bedrooms.” Barghouthi also called the people of the “west Bank” to be “the spearhead” and be “ready to make the ultimate sacrifice.”</p>On May 18, 2016, SUPER UW <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/SuperUw/posts/1105113599551201\">encouraged </a>students to sign a petition to Israel to release Barghouthi from jail. Barghouthi was <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/middle-east/israel-palestine-incitement-facebook-professor-imad-barghouth-a7362106.html\">sentenced</a> to prison for seven months for incitement to violence.<p></p><p>On July 13, 2016, SUPER UW also <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/SuperUw/posts/1141360742593153\">invited </a>students on Facebook to sign a petition calling on Israel to release Palestinian poet Dareen Tatour from house arrest. </p><p>Tatour was placed under house arrest for petry that fueled the violence known as the “<a href=\"http://mosaicmagazine.com/observation/2016/03/what-palestinians-think-about-the-knife-intifada/\">Knife Intifada</a>” the previous fall.  Tatour had supported the terror group <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamic_Jihad_Movement_in_Palestine\">Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ)</a> and <a href=\"http://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/.premium-1.720418\">posted</a> to her 4,800 + Facebook friends “I am the next shahid [martyr]” on Facebook under a picture of attempted-murderess <a href=\"http://www.timesofisrael.com/attempted-afula-stabber-identified-as-nazareth-woman/\">Asraa Zidan Tawfik Abed</a>. Tatour also <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R1qnlN1WUAA\">posted</a> a Youtube video of stone-throwing Palestinian youths and Israeli soldiers voiced-over by a woman reading a poem that glorified violence  and rejected peaceful solutions. The poem urged listeners to “follow the caravan of martyrs and shred the disgraceful constitution which imposed degradation and humiliation and deterred us from restoring justice.”<br></p><p>On May 23, 2016, SUPER PSU <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/events/550241521820620/\">hosted</a> an event featuring <a href=\"https://canarymission.org/professor/Nada_Elia\">Nada Elia</a> who — in October of 2015, while Palestinians across Israel <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xz-bXKOqDqQ\">stabbed</a> scores of <a href=\"http://mfa.gov.il/MFA/ForeignPolicy/Terrorism/Palestinian/Pages/Wave-of-terror-October-2015.aspx\">Israeli civilians</a> during the “<a href=\"http://mosaicmagazine.com/observation/2016/03/what-palestinians-think-about-the-knife-intifada/\">Knife Intifada</a>” — <a href=\"http://www.middleeasteye.net/columns/why-be-afraid-intifada-152825522\">wrote</a> an article titled “Why Be Afraid of an Intifada?” where she said “Intifadas are good.”</p><p>For more information on the history of SJP,  an <a href=\"http://superpsu.weebly.com/media.html\">affiliate</a> of SUPER, see<a href=\"https://canarymission.org/organization/Students_For_Justice_In_Palestine\"> SJP</a>.<br></p>",

The two largest and most active SUPER chapters are SUPER PSU and SUPER UW. Below is a summary of these two SUPER chapters’ activities.</p><h2>SUPER PSU </h2><p><b>Honoring Terrorists</b><br></p><p>On November 19, 2014, SUPER PSU <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/events/878580385500122/\">hosted</a> an event for <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rasmea_Odeh\">Rasmea Odeh</a>, calling the charge on which Odeh was tried and convicted “nothing but a pretext to attack this icon of the Palestine liberation movement.” </p><p>Rasmea Odeh was a <a href=\"http://legalinsurrection.com/2014/11/rasmea-odeh-rightly-convicted-of-israeli-supermarket-bombing-and-u-s-immigration-fraud/\">military operative </a>with the <a href=\"http://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-30099510\">Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP)</a>, an <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Popular_Front_For_The_Liberation_Of_Palestine\">internationally designated</a> terrorist organization. In 1969, she masterminded a <a href=\"http://www.jta.org/1969/02/24/archive/jerusalem-supersol-re-opens-for-business-2-young-bombing-victims-are-buried\">bombing</a> that killed two university students in a Jerusalem supermarket. Odeh also attempted to bomb the British consulate.</p><p>Odeh confessed, in a highly detailed <a href=\"https://www.scribd.com/document/288292022/Rasmieh-Odeh-Case-March-1-and-7-1969-Ramieh-Confessions-Exh-I-to-Govt-Response-to-Motion-for-Reconsideration-of-Bond-Revocation\">account</a>, the day following her arrest. In a 2004 documentary, one of Odeh’s co-conspirators <a href=\"https://youtu.be/kfGhHu6VYlE?t=44\">directly implicated</a> her as the mastermind. </p><p>In 1970, an Israeli court tried and convicted Odeh for her involvement in both bombings and sentenced her to life imprisonment. However, Odeh was released 10 years later, in a prisoner swap and emigrated to the United States.</p><p>On February 27, 2016, SUPER PSU <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/events/508601476009375/\">hosted</a> a Palestinian Cultural Night, featuring multiple visual displays that <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/PSUSUPER/photos/a.1027863777252566.1073741832.252848371420781/1027872360585041/?type=3&amp;theater\">honored</a> terrorists, like <a href=\"http://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-30099510\">Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP)</a> members <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leila_Khaled\">Leila Khaled</a> and Rasmea Odeh.</p><p>Leila Khaled was a leading member of the <a href=\"http://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-30099510\">Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP)</a> and participated in the hijacking of<a href=\"http://adst.org/2015/08/the-pflp-hijacking-of-twa-840/\"> TWA Flight 840</a> in 1969 and<a href=\"http://middleeast.about.com/od/terrorism/a/dawson-field-hijackings.htm\"> El Al Flight 219</a> in 1970.</p><p>In a 2014 <a href=\"http://elderofziyon.blogspot.com/2014/04/mondoweiss-and-human-rights-activist.html#.U0P_D6hdWuK\">interview</a>, Khaled opined that the Palestinian <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnxOggdPWXg&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=69\">second intifada </a>failed because it was not violent enough. </p><p>As of 2016, Khaled remained a <a href=\"http://pflp.ps/english/2016/02/02/leila-khaled-at-the-new-world-summit-palestinian-people-have-struggled-100-years-for-liberation/\">member</a> of PFLP's Political Bureau.

The attack killed 26 people.<br></p><p></p><p>The scholarship was offered by the <a href=\"http://www.pal-youth.org/category/branches/usa/\">Palestinian Youth Movement (PYM USA)</a>. PYM’s website <a href=\"http://www.pal-youth.org/the-road-to-liberation-30-11-2012/\">states</a> “Our liberation...will be gained with the path that was written with the blood of our martyrs. We reaffirm that the only path that we are concerned with is the path that explicitly heads towards the liberation of our land and the return of our people to Palestine… All Palestine.” </p><p>On June 30, 2015, SUPER UW <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/SuperUw/posts/926635400732356\">encouraged</a> students to “please take action” and sign a petition calling on Israel to free Khader Adnan, who was in his 54th day of a hunger strike at the time.</p><p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khader_Adnan\">Khader Adnan</a> is a senior member of the terrorist organization Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ). PIJ “is dedicated to the violent destruction of Israel,” and has no ‘political wing’ or ‘social wing’, only a ‘military wing’ that focuses solely on promoting terrorism and the murder of Israelis. It is <a href=\"http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/world/islamic-jihad-prisoner-khader-adnan-ends-hunger-strike/story-e6frg6so-1226278714609\">reported</a> that the group is backed by Iran and has killed dozens of Israelis in suicide bombings and other attacks.</p><p>A 2007 YouTube <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CtPQ4EqePqw\">video</a> showed Adnan praising and encouraging suicide bombings: \"Who among you will carry the next explosive belt? Who among you will fire the next bullets? Who among you will have his body parts blown all over?”</p><p></p><p><b>Promoting Incitement</b></p>On October 13, 2016, SUPER UW <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/SuperUw/posts/1231127020283191\">shared </a>an <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/SuperUw/posts/1231127020283191\">article </a>on Facebook that accused Israel of arresting Palestinian Astrophysicist and Professor at Al Quds University Imad Barghouthi for getting “likes and shares on facebook,” trivializing the effects of Barghouthi’s incitement. The article was published by the anti-Israel website <a href=\"https://electronicintifada.net/\">Electronic Intifada</a>.<p></p><p>Barghouti is a vocal <a href=\"http://www.memri.org/tv/palestinian-astrophysics-professor-imad-barghouthi-urges-development-missiles-archival\">supporter </a>of Hamas’s military wing the Izz ad-Din al-Qassam Brigades and has called for killing and being killed in the name of Islam.</p><p></p><p>A <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/memri.org/videos/10154190511739717/\">video</a>, published on October 22, 2014, showed Barghouthi, at an Al-Quds university <a href=\"https://canarymission.org/organization/Hamas\">Hamas</a> rally, draped in a Hamas banner, calling upon students to design weapons. He urged students to devote themselves to designing precision guided missiles and sniper rifles to target “zionist soldiers” and “to hunt them down in their bedrooms.” Barghouthi also called the people of the “west Bank” to be “the spearhead” and be “ready to make the ultimate sacrifice.”</p>On May 18, 2016, SUPER UW <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/SuperUw/posts/1105113599551201\">encouraged </a>students to sign a petition to Israel to release Barghouthi from jail. Barghouthi was <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/middle-east/israel-palestine-incitement-facebook-professor-imad-barghouth-a7362106.html\">sentenced</a> to prison for seven months for incitement to violence.<p></p><p>On July 13, 2016, SUPER UW also <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/SuperUw/posts/1141360742593153\">invited </a>students on Facebook to sign a petition calling on Israel to release Palestinian poet Dareen Tatour from house arrest. </p><p>Tatour was placed under house arrest for petry that fueled the violence known as the “<a href=\"http://mosaicmagazine.com/observation/2016/03/what-palestinians-think-about-the-knife-intifada/\">Knife Intifada</a>” the previous fall.  Tatour had supported the terror group <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamic_Jihad_Movement_in_Palestine\">Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ)</a> and <a href=\"http://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/.premium-1.720418\">posted</a> to her 4,800 + Facebook friends “I am the next shahid [martyr]” on Facebook under a picture of attempted-murderess <a href=\"http://www.timesofisrael.com/attempted-afula-stabber-identified-as-nazareth-woman/\">Asraa Zidan Tawfik Abed</a>. Tatour also <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R1qnlN1WUAA\">posted</a> a Youtube video of stone-throwing Palestinian youths and Israeli soldiers voiced-over by a woman reading a poem that glorified violence  and rejected peaceful solutions. The poem urged listeners to “follow the caravan of martyrs and shred the disgraceful constitution which imposed degradation and humiliation and deterred us from restoring justice.”<br></p><p>On May 23, 2016, SUPER PSU <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/events/550241521820620/\">hosted</a> an event featuring <a href=\"https://canarymission.org/professor/Nada_Elia\">Nada Elia</a> who — in October of 2015, while Palestinians across Israel <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xz-bXKOqDqQ\">stabbed</a> scores of <a href=\"http://mfa.gov.il/MFA/ForeignPolicy/Terrorism/Palestinian/Pages/Wave-of-terror-October-2015.aspx\">Israeli civilians</a> during the “<a href=\"http://mosaicmagazine.com/observation/2016/03/what-palestinians-think-about-the-knife-intifada/\">Knife Intifada</a>” — <a href=\"http://www.middleeasteye.net/columns/why-be-afraid-intifada-152825522\">wrote</a> an article titled “Why Be Afraid of an Intifada?” where she said “Intifadas are good.”</p><p>For more information on the history of SJP,  an <a href=\"http://superpsu.weebly.com/media.html\">affiliate</a> of SUPER, see<a href=\"https://canarymission.org/organization/Students_For_Justice_In_Palestine\"> SJP</a>.<br></p>",

Concordia maintains an SPHR chapter and McGill maintains a separate SPHR chapter.</p><p>SPHR gained notoriety after <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concordia_University_Netanyahu_riot\">instigating</a> a riot at Concordia, that forced Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to cancel a speech scheduled for September 9, 2002. Ticket holders later reported that the protesters subjected them to anti-Semitic slogans — and physical attacks. A Holocaust survivor was <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concordia_University_Netanyahu_riot\">kicked</a> in the groin and a local rabbi with his wife were <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concordia_University_Netanyahu_riot\">assaulted and spat on</a>.</p><p style=\"text-align: left;\">As of February 2017, SPHR had active branches on nine university campuses in Canada — in addition to <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/sphr.official/\" >Concordia</a> and <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/sphrmcgill/\" >McGill</a> —  including: <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/Solidarit%C3%A9-pour-les-droits-humains-des-Palestiniennes-et-Palestiniens-UdeM-645733245566637/\" >Université de Montréal</a> (UdeM), <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/SDHPP.UQAM/\" >Université du Québec à Montréal</a> (UQAM), <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/sphruottawa/\" >University of Ottawa</a> (UofO), <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/SPHRQueens/\" >Queen's University</a> (Queens), <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/sphr.mac/\" >McMaster University</a> (Mac), <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/ubcsphr/\" >University of British Columbia</a> (UBC), <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/sphrcalgary/\" >University of Calgary</a> (Calgary), <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/sphr.lethbridge\" >Lethbridge college</a> (Lethbridge) and <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/SPHRATUWO\" >University of Western Ontario</a> (UWO).<br></p><p>George Brown College (George Brown) and the University of Guelph (UoGuelph) also had SPHR chapters <a href=\"http://www.palestinianconference.org/an-open-letter-to-the-university-of-manitoba-students-union-from-the-canadian-students-coalition-for-palestine/\">until</a> 2013. However, as of 2017, both appeared to be inactive. The SPHR <a href=\"http://www.palestinianconference.org/an-open-letter-to-the-university-of-manitoba-students-union-from-the-canadian-students-coalition-for-palestine/\">chapter </a>at University of Waterloo (UW) changed its name after 2013, to <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/sfpruw/\">UW Students For Palestinian Rights</a> (<a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/sfpruw/\">SPFR</a>).</p><p></p><p>SPHR chapters have consistently defended violence against Israelis. SPHR chapters have also used demonization of Israel to justify terrorism.</p>SPHR Concordia’s <a href=\"https://csu.qc.ca/sites/default/files/%5Bcurrent-user%3Afeed-node%3Aauthor%3Aname%5D/constitutions/1442273669/SPHR%20Constitution.docx\">constitution</a> (last updated February 25, 2015) denies the Jewish people’s right to national self-determination. The group aspires “to promote and protect Palestinian human rights both locally and internationally,” including what it calls “the right of resistance against human rights abuses.” <p></p><p></p><h2>Camouflaging Campus Violence</h2>On April 14, 2013, seven SPHR chapters, including SPHR Guelph and SPHR George Brown, <a href=\"http://www.palestinianconference.org/an-open-letter-to-the-university-of-manitoba-students-union-from-the-canadian-students-coalition-for-palestine/\">signed </a>a petition opposing a University of Manitoba Students’ Union (UMSU) Council <a href=\"http://news.nationalpost.com/news/canada/university-of-manitoba-students-union-students-against-israeli-apartheid\">decision </a>to revoke the student club status of UM Students Against Israeli Apartheid (SAIA) two days prior.<div><p><br></p><div><p>The petition's signatories said that SAIA is part of a peaceful movement, and claimed that the UMSU “without any evidence” alleged that incidents of violence and harassment in universities across Canada surrounded SAIA’s promotion of Israel Apartheid Week (IAW). The signatories denied any IAW endorsement of violence and harassment “of any group of students” and claimed “we have not heard anything of these supposed incidents of “violence and harassment.”<br></p><div><div>However, in 2009, violent pro-Palestinian activists, including SAIA members, <a href=\"http://www.canada.com/life/story.html?id=1343206\">attacked </a>Jewish students at York University, <a href=\"https://youtu.be/12hApMpQlds?t=49s\">shouting </a>“Zionism equals racism!” and “Racists off campus!” The students eventually <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkmRhgZqTwQ&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=122\">barricaded</a> themselves inside the Hillel offices, as  attackers banged the door and windows, screaming anti-Semitic slurs, like “Die Jew,” “Get the hell off campus,” “Go back to Israel” and “F**king Jew\".<br><br>In 2011, following the <a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/education/university/cusa-meeting-explodes-over-anti-israel-motion/\">shelving </a>of a divestment motion by Carleton University Students’ Association (CUSA), approximately 200 SAIA protesters <a href=\"https://twitter.com/DelroyDyer89/status/38430677494018048\">reportedly</a> began rioting outside the council room, “banging on the walls, yelling ‘shame’ and screaming.” Students reported they were subject to physical intimidation, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ariellakimmel/status/38410136104079360\">threats </a>and homophobic slurs for opposing the SAIA motion, and felt trapped and threatened. Students, who felt unsafe to venture out of the room during SAIA’s outburst, were escorted out when additional security arrived.<br><p></p><p>On February 18, 2011, Hashem Hamdy, a CUSA councillor in the Faculty of Public Affairs, <a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/education/university/cusa-meeting-explodes-over-anti-israel-motion/\">said </a>in a release.  “[m]y personal safety was threatened repeatedly last night, and I am extremely apprehensive about coming onto campus now.

The signatories denied any IAW endorsement of violence and harassment “of any group of students” and claimed “we have not heard anything of these supposed incidents of “violence and harassment.”<br></p><div><div>However, in 2009, violent pro-Palestinian activists, including SAIA members, <a href=\"http://www.canada.com/life/story.html?id=1343206\">attacked </a>Jewish students at York University, <a href=\"https://youtu.be/12hApMpQlds?t=49s\">shouting </a>“Zionism equals racism!” and “Racists off campus!” The students eventually <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkmRhgZqTwQ&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=122\">barricaded</a> themselves inside the Hillel offices, as  attackers banged the door and windows, screaming anti-Semitic slurs, like “Die Jew,” “Get the hell off campus,” “Go back to Israel” and “F**king Jew\".<br><br>In 2011, following the <a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/education/university/cusa-meeting-explodes-over-anti-israel-motion/\">shelving </a>of a divestment motion by Carleton University Students’ Association (CUSA), approximately 200 SAIA protesters <a href=\"https://twitter.com/DelroyDyer89/status/38430677494018048\">reportedly</a> began rioting outside the council room, “banging on the walls, yelling ‘shame’ and screaming.” Students reported they were subject to physical intimidation, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ariellakimmel/status/38410136104079360\">threats </a>and homophobic slurs for opposing the SAIA motion, and felt trapped and threatened. Students, who felt unsafe to venture out of the room during SAIA’s outburst, were escorted out when additional security arrived.<br><p></p><p>On February 18, 2011, Hashem Hamdy, a CUSA councillor in the Faculty of Public Affairs, <a href=\"http://www.macleans.ca/education/university/cusa-meeting-explodes-over-anti-israel-motion/\">said </a>in a release.  “[m]y personal safety was threatened repeatedly last night, and I am extremely apprehensive about coming onto campus now. I feel like a marked man, like many other students on campus.”<br><br>IAW itself has also been a locus of violence and harassment. During an event at the 2009 Israeli Apartheid Week <a href=\"http://www.cjnews.com/living-jewish/jewish-learning/jewish-students-face-incidents-u-t-queens\">coordinated</a> by SAIA at the University of Toronto (UofT), Isaac Apter, a UofT alumnus, who urged a speaker to forthrightly address why Hamas had persistently refused to recognize the legitimacy of Israel, was grabbed by a  SAIA-hired usher and commanded: “You shut the f**k up!” <br><br>In 2010, it was <a href=\"http://www.queensjournal.ca/story/2010-03-05/news/israeli-apartheid-week-turning-heat/\">reported </a>that York University had cancelled events associated with Israeli Apartheid Week, citing security concerns.

Khaled</a> was a leading member of the PFLP and participated in the hijacking of<a href=\"http://adst.org/2015/08/the-pflp-hijacking-of-twa-840/\"> TWA Flight 840</a> in 1969 and<a href=\"http://middleeast.about.com/od/terrorism/a/dawson-field-hijackings.htm\"> El Al Flight 219</a> in 1970.<br></p><p>On November 19, 2013 SFSU President Les Wong released a statement <a href=\"http://www.amchainitiative.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/Wong2.pdf\">condemning</a> the GUPS SFSU mural event as anti-Semitic. California State legislators <a href=\"http://www.amchainitiative.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/LettertoSFSUPresident.pdf\">issued</a> a letter thanking President Wong for condemning “[c]elebrations of violence” and “hateful demonstrations [that] foster prejudice and bigotry” and “seek to intimidate the Jewish community.”</p><p>As of 2016, Leila Khaled remains a <a href=\"http://pflp.ps/english/2016/02/02/leila-khaled-at-the-new-world-summit-palestinian-people-have-struggled-100-years-for-liberation/\">member</a> of PFLP's Political Bureau. The PFLP <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/middle-east/jerusalem-synagogue-attack-popular-front-for-the-liberation-of-palestine-claims-responsibility-9868981.html\">claimed</a> “credit” for the 2001 <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2001/oct/17/israel2\">assassination </a>of the Israeli tourism minister, the 2011 <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Itamar_attack\">massacre</a> of the Fogel family (including an infant and small children) and the 2014 attack on a Har Nof Synagogue — where <a href=\"http://mfa.gov.il/MFA/ForeignPolicy/Terrorism/Palestinian/Pages/Terror-attack-in-Jerusalem-synagogue-18-Nov-2014.aspx\">six worshipers</a> were murdered during <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/19/world/middleeast/killings-in-jerusalem-synagogue-complex.html?_r=0\">morning prayers</a> in Jerusalem. </p><p>On March 9, 2016, GUPS reaffirmed its support for Khaled. The group <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/GeneralUnionofPalestineStudents/photos/a.427821270610383.99022.419960624729781/1032679160124588/?type=3&amp;theater\">posted</a> on Facebook a photo of a mural featuring her — with the comment “Happy International Women's Day to all of the fierce women resisting colonial powers and repression every day!”</p><p>On February 21, 2016, GUPS SFSU held an <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/GeneralUnionofPalestineStudents/photos/a.427821270610383.99022.419960624729781/1023459584379879/?type=3&amp;theater\">event</a> in support of hunger-striking <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muhammad_al-Qiq\">Muhammad al-Qiq</a>, who Israel detained for Hamas terror-related activities. The GUPS event <a href=\"https://bbcwatch.org/tag/mohammed-al-qiq/\">misleadingly</a> characterized al-Qiq merely as a “journalist.”</p><p></p><h2>Glorifying Terrorism</h2>On March 3, 2016, GUPS SFSU <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/GeneralUnionofPalestineStudents/posts/1029247750467729\">announced </a>on Facebook the opportunity to apply to the annual “Ghassan Kanafani Scholarship Foundation.”<br><br>Kanafani was a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghassan_Kanafani\">leading member</a> and spokesperson of the PFLP in its early years.<br>Kanafani announced his organization’s responsibility for the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lod_Airport_massacre\">Lod Airport Massacre</a> of May 30, 1972 — an action killed 26 people.<br><p></p><p>The scholarship was offered by the <a href=\"http://www.pal-youth.org/category/branches/usa/\">Palestinian Youth Movement (PYM)</a>. PYM’s website <a href=\"http://www.pal-youth.org/the-road-to-liberation-30-11-2012/\">states</a>: “Our liberation… will be gained with the path that was written with the blood of our martyrs. We reaffirm that the only path that we are concerned with is the path that explicitly heads towards the liberation of our land and the return of our people to Palestine… All Palestine.” </p><h2>BDS Activity</h2><p>In July 2014, GUPS SFSU <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/GeneralUnionofPalestineStudents/posts/719398081452699\">encouraged</a> its Facebook followers celebrating Ramadan to boycott Israeli dates. The Facebook post <a href=\"http://www.inminds.com/boycott-israeli-dates.php\">linked</a> to a site detailing the boycott effort and featuring a banner with signs reading “Zionism is Racism - Boycott Israel” and “Stop Funding Genocide - Boycott Israel.” <br><br>In October of 2014, GUPS SFSU <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/events/1447374682195857/\">endorsed</a> a “Block the Boat Protest” where BDS supporters <a href=\"https://electronicintifada.net/blogs/charlotte-silver/israeli-ship-blocked-unloading-oakland-four-straight-days\">stopped</a> a shipment from ZIM, an Israeli shipping company, from unloading its cargo in Oakland, California.</p><p>On May 28, 2013, GUPS SFSU <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/events/520180981380789/\">advertised </a>on Facebook an event featuring anti-Israel activist Abir Kopty speaking on “why BDS is important for resistance on the ground.”</p><p></p><h2>Faculty Advisor with Terror Links</h2><br>GUPS SFSU’s faculty advisor, Professor <a href=\"https://canarymission.org/professor/Rabab_Abdulhadi\">Rabab Abdulhadi</a>, has made efforts to establish ties between SFSU and <a href=\"https://canarymission.org/organization/Hamas\">Hamas</a>-dominated Palestinian universities, Birzeit and An-Najah. <p></p><p>In January of 2014, Abdulhadi <a href=\"http://www.americanthinker.com/articles/2015/05/statefunded_university_promoting_alliances_with_hamasdominated_palestinian_universities.html\">organized </a>and participated in a controversial, university-funded “Academic and Labor Delegation to Palestine.”</p><p>The ostensible purpose of the trip was “to attend an international conference and to research, network, and collaborate with potential university partners towards a possible memorandum of understanding.” <br><br>During the trip, Abdulhadi met with individuals <a href=\"http://www.jihadwatch.org/2014/05/sfsu-profs-met-with-terrorists-tied-to-american-deaths-on-taxpayers-dime\">affiliated</a> with American State Department-designated terrorist organizations, including Leila Khaled and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raed_Salah\">Sheikh Raed Salah.<br><br></a>Although not advertised in the 2014-2015 <a href=\"http://senate.sfsu.edu/sites/sites7.sfsu.edu.senate/files/AUCIP%20End%20of%20Year%20Report.pdf\">annual report</a> for SFSU, a February 2015 <a href=\"http://www.najah.edu/node/34561\">statement</a> on the An-Najah website attested that an memorandum of understanding was signed between An-Najah and SFSU following Abdelhadi’s visit.</p><p>On September 21, 2016, GUPS SFSU <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/GeneralUnionofPalestineStudents/posts/1169669026425600\">posted </a>a <a href=\"https://medium.com/@sfsugups415/gups-statement-of-support-for-sf-states-mou-with-al-najah-university-in-palestine-the-amed-c612dd2ffe3c#.f60vzsxfk\">statement </a>of support for Abdulhadi and the memorandum with An-Najah and condemned pro-Israel organizations for denouncing the partnership. <br></p><h2>Probation for Intimidating Jewish Students</h2><p></p><p>In April 2002, GUPS SFSU students <a href=\"http://www.sfsu.edu/~news/response/summary.htm\">circulated </a>a flyer advertising a pro-Palestinian event entitled: “Genocide in the 21st Century.” Invoking a medieval anti-Semitic blood libel, the flyer featured a dead baby on a soup can label, framed by two Israeli flags and the words “Made in Israel -- Palestinian Children Meat -- Slaughtered According to Jewish Rites Under American License.” <br></p><p>In May of 2002, at the end of a pro-Israel peace rally sponsored by the SFSU Hillel, GUPS SFSU students who had been participating in a counter demonstration <a href=\"http://www.freerepublic.com/focus/news/684040/posts\">surrounded </a>the Hillel students and threatened them verbally and physically. According to one eye-witness, angry GUPS SFSU students poured into the plaza, screaming \"Get out or we will kill you!\" and \"Hitler did not finish the job!\"</p><p>Jewish students had to be accompanied to the Hillel House under armed police protection.</p><p>In response to these incidents, SFSU President Robert A. Corrigan put the GUPS SFSU students on <a href=\"http://www.sfsu.edu/~news/response/133.htm\">probation </a>for a year.</p>",

PLO leader <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yasser_Arafat\">Yasser Arafat</a> officially founded GUPS in Cairo in 1959. </p><p>The SFSU chapter of GUPS was <a href=\"http://www.nationalsjp.org/gups--sfsu.html\">founded </a>in 1973, at a time when the American State Department still listed the PLO as a foreign terrorist entity.</p><p>GUPS <a href=\"https://electronicintifada.net/content/rebuilding-general-union-palestinian-students/7821\">describes </a>its overall goal as organizing student activists to achieve justice and freedom for the Palestinian people. To this end, GUPS claims to form an umbrella organization for Palestinian student groups and to form alliances with non-Palestinian groups. GUPS’s focus, however, is almost entirely on its anti-Israel campaigns, including <a href=\"http://www.freerepublic.com/focus/news/684040/posts\">harassment</a>, <a href=\"http://www.sfsu.edu/~news/response/summary.htm\">anti-Semitic libels</a>, <a href=\"http://www.jweekly.com/article/full/70176/outcry-over-anti-semitism-at-mural-event-at-s.f.-state/\">celebrating </a>violence, <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/GeneralUnionofPalestineStudents/posts/1029247750467729\">glorifying </a>terrorists, <a href=\"http://www.antisemitismatsfsu.blogspot.com/2014/05/san-francisco-state-gups-attempts-to.html\">intimidating </a>pro-Israel voices and <a href=\"http://goldengatexpress.org/2016/04/07/general-union-of-palestine-students-storm-meeting-with-jerusalem-mayor/\">shutting down </a>pro-Israel events, <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/GeneralUnionofPalestineStudents/posts/719398081452699\">supporting </a>the <a href=\"https://canarymission.org/organization/Boycott_Divestment_Sanctions\">Boycott, Divestment, Sanctions (BDS)</a> movement, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OgWGN5t0cCI&amp;t=7s\">Israel-Apartheid initiatives</a>, <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/GeneralUnionofPalestineStudents/photos/a.673419969383844.1073741826.419960624729781/953487938043711/?type=3\">“die-ins”</a> as well as <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T9zDAHqmdEw&amp;t=20s\">rallies </a>and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c-i2dGLjCLI\">protests</a>.</p><p></p><h2>GUPS Leadership Supporting Terror and Violence</h2>Former GUPS leaders at SFSU include <a href=\"https://canarymission.org/individual/Mohammad-G_Hammad\">Mohammad G Hammad</a>, <a href=\"https://canarymission.org/individual/Lubna_Morrar\">Lubna Morrar</a> and <a href=\"https://canarymission.org/individual/Linda_Ereikat\">Linda Ereikat</a>.<p></p><p>GUPS SFSU president Mohammad G. Hammad left SFSU after posting murderous rants on his Tumblr page that threatened violence and expressed praise for the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Popular_Front_For_The_Liberation_Of_Palestine\">Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP)</a>.</p><p>On August 10, 2013, Hammad <a href=\"http://jewishjournal.com/nation/125121/\">posted </a>a picture of himself holding a knife with the caption reading, “I seriously can not get over how much I love this blade. It is the sharpest thing I own and cuts through everything like butter and just holding it makes me want to stab an Israeli soldier.”</p><p>Campus anti-Semitism watchdog group, AMCHA, compiled the material and sent it to university officials, the FBI, the San Francisco Police Department and the San Francisco District Attorney. SFSU <a href=\"http://proisraelbaybloggers.blogspot.co.il/2014/02/the-nightmare-is-over-at-san-francisco.html\">announced</a> that Hammad was no longer enrolled as a student as of the 2014 Spring semester, without specifying a reason.</p><p>Lubna Morrar was president of GUPS SFSU from 2014-2015. She has <a href=\"https://youtu.be/SGIYrHlJla0\">written </a>and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E_sdN_SgPSY\">performed</a> aggressively anti-Semitic poetry and used social media to spread hatred for Jews and <a href=\"https://canarymission.org/individual/Lubna_Morrar\">praise </a>for terrorism but deleted her social media accounts after Canary Mission profiled her. Morrar led the chanting at the 2016 protest against Jerusalem Mayor Nir Barkat, of “<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXSqQ2okBbw\">Get the f**k off our campus</a>!”</p><p>GUPS SFSU activist Linda Ereikat <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NFZo5iX9vHA\">led</a> the April 2016 <a href=\"http://goldengatexpress.org/2016/04/07/general-union-of-palestine-students-storm-meeting-with-jerusalem-mayor/\">disruption</a> of Jerusalem Mayor Nir Barkat’s speech together with Morrar. She is a regular leader of anti-Israel demonstrations <a href=\"https://youtu.be/k7eOtVD9S0o?t=21m20s\">like</a> “Block the Boat” and can be seen <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-mjnjwwEDi8\">chanting </a>“We Support the Intifada!” in front of the Israeli consulate, referring to the Arabic term for terror waves that often targets Israeli civilians. </p><p></p><h2>Harassing Jerusalem’s Mayor</h2>On April 6, 2016, a large group of anti-Israel protesters <a href=\"http://goldengatexpress.org/2016/04/07/general-union-of-palestine-students-storm-meeting-with-jerusalem-mayor/\">shouted down</a> Jerusalem Mayor Nir Barkat as he was speaking at SFSU. The protest was led by GUPS SFSU and <a href=\"http://goldengatexpress.org/2016/04/07/general-union-of-palestine-students-storm-meeting-with-jerusalem-mayor/\">joined</a> by members of the Black Student Union, Defend and Advance Ethnic Studies and the League of Filipino Students.<p></p><p>Upon entering the room where Barkat was addressing SFSU students, Lubna Morrar led the group in <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qXSqQ2okBbw\">yelling</a> “Get the f**k of our campus!”</p><p>Following that, Linda Ereikat led the group in violent chants, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ooaH7nKYz0\">including </a>“<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ooaH7nKYz0\">Intifada, Intifada</a>!” <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NFZo5iX9vHA\">and</a> “If we don’t get no justice, then you don’t get no peace!”</p><p>Barkat’s personal security guards ensured his safety and a campus police officer arrived while student leaders from the event attempted to dialogue with the protesters. The protesters <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=My-V_EftVgo\">persisted</a> in their disruption, forcing Barkat to move from the podium to sit with the audience, in an attempt to continue his talk.</p><p>On April 7, 2016, SFSU President Les Wong <a href=\"http://president.sfsu.edu/sites/sites7.sfsu.edu.president/files/Presidential%20Response%204-7-16.pdf\">issued</a> a statement, condemning the protesters for the disruption. He promised to open an investigation of the incident. </p><p>GUPS SFSU’s history of disruption and intimidation goes back to May 2014, when the director of SFSU Hillel, a Jewish campus group, <a href=\"http://www.antisemitismatsfsu.blogspot.com/2014/05/san-francisco-state-gups-attempts-to.html\">reported</a> that GUPS SFSU students invaded Hillel’s celebration of Israel’s Independence Day. The protest included “extreme” chants and Hillel’s director reported that “as hundreds gathered to watch the spectacle, it became very tense.”</p><h2>Inciting Violence</h2><p>On October 14, 2015 —  following months of <a href=\"http://www.cnsnews.com/news/article/zachary-leshin/violent-october-620-terror-attacks-just-one-month-left-one-american-10\">raging</a> Palestinian violence<a href=\"http://www.cnsnews.com/news/article/zachary-leshin/violent-october-620-terror-attacks-just-one-month-left-one-american-10\"> directed mainly</a> against <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3270379/Two-Israelis-die-latest-Jerusalem-carnage-One-person-stabbed-death-street-killed-bus-gun-attack.html\">Israeli civilians</a> — GUPS SFSU <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/GeneralUnionofPalestineStudents/photos/a.427821270610383.99022.419960624729781/960183580707480/?type=3&amp;theater\">posted</a> on Facebook that it “supports the uprising in Palestine.” The post continued: “We Stand with our Brothers and Sisters in the streets, and we will find victory!” </p><p>The post called for an “End to the colonist empire! We will not be silenced!” and an “End to the Zionist State!”  </p><p>October 2015 saw an upsurge in <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-israel-palestinians-idUSKCN0S70JD20151014\">violence</a> across Israel incited by Palestinian <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xii-97MU6SQ&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=25\">political</a> and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xii-97MU6SQ&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=207\">religious</a> leaders. The wave of stabbings — known as the “<a href=\"http://mosaicmagazine.com/observation/2016/03/what-palestinians-think-about-the-knife-intifada/\">Knife Intifada</a>” — saw young Palestinians throughout the country <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xz-bXKOqDqQ\">stabbing</a> and attempting to stab scores of Israeli civilians.</p><h2>Celebrating Terrorists\t</h2><p>On November 7, 2013, GUPS SFSU <a href=\"http://www.jweekly.com/article/full/70176/outcry-over-anti-semitism-at-mural-event-at-s.f.-state/\">celebrated</a> a Palestinian mural on SFSU’s campus by setting up an art station for students to create their own <a href=\"http://www.amchainitiative.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/my-heroes-have-always-killed-colonizers.jpg\">placards</a> — using a pre-made stencil with the words “MY HEROES HAVE ALWAYS KILLED COLONIZERS.” </p><p>An article <a href=\"http://www.ism-norcal.org/support-amed-sfsu-against-false-accusations-please-sign-and-circulate-widely/\">appearing</a> on the Northern California International Solidarity Movement (ISM) website confirmed that GUPS SFSU provided an additional stencil, featuring an image of <a href=\"http://www.jpost.com/International/SA-Jews-blast-BDSers-for-hosting-double-hijacker-387673\">convicted </a>airline hijacker <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leila_Khaled\">Leila Khaled.

California State legislators <a href=\"http://www.amchainitiative.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/LettertoSFSUPresident.pdf\">issued</a> a letter thanking President Wong for condemning “[c]elebrations of violence” and “hateful demonstrations [that] foster prejudice and bigotry” and “seek to intimidate the Jewish community.”</p><p>As of 2016, Leila Khaled remains a <a href=\"http://pflp.ps/english/2016/02/02/leila-khaled-at-the-new-world-summit-palestinian-people-have-struggled-100-years-for-liberation/\">member</a> of PFLP's Political Bureau.

The Facebook post <a href=\"http://www.inminds.com/boycott-israeli-dates.php\">linked</a> to a site detailing the boycott effort and featuring a banner with signs reading “Zionism is Racism - Boycott Israel” and “Stop Funding Genocide - Boycott Israel.” <br><br>In October of 2014, GUPS SFSU <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/events/1447374682195857/\">endorsed</a> a “Block the Boat Protest” where BDS supporters <a href=\"https://electronicintifada.net/blogs/charlotte-silver/israeli-ship-blocked-unloading-oakland-four-straight-days\">stopped</a> a shipment from ZIM, an Israeli shipping company, from unloading its cargo in Oakland, California.</p><p>On May 28, 2013, GUPS SFSU <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/events/520180981380789/\">advertised </a>on Facebook an event featuring anti-Israel activist Abir Kopty speaking on “why BDS is important for resistance on the ground.”</p><p></p><h2>Faculty Advisor with Terror Links</h2><br>GUPS SFSU’s faculty advisor, Professor <a href=\"https://canarymission.org/professor/Rabab_Abdulhadi\">Rabab Abdulhadi</a>, has made efforts to establish ties between SFSU and <a href=\"https://canarymission.org/organization/Hamas\">Hamas</a>-dominated Palestinian universities, Birzeit and An-Najah. <p></p><p>In January of 2014, Abdulhadi <a href=\"http://www.americanthinker.com/articles/2015/05/statefunded_university_promoting_alliances_with_hamasdominated_palestinian_universities.html\">organized </a>and participated in a controversial, university-funded “Academic and Labor Delegation to Palestine.”</p><p>The ostensible purpose of the trip was “to attend an international conference and to research, network, and collaborate with potential university partners towards a possible memorandum of understanding.” <br><br>During the trip, Abdulhadi met with individuals <a href=\"http://www.jihadwatch.org/2014/05/sfsu-profs-met-with-terrorists-tied-to-american-deaths-on-taxpayers-dime\">affiliated</a> with American State Department-designated terrorist organizations, including Leila Khaled and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raed_Salah\">Sheikh Raed Salah.<br><br></a>Although not advertised in the 2014-2015 <a href=\"http://senate.sfsu.edu/sites/sites7.sfsu.edu.senate/files/AUCIP%20End%20of%20Year%20Report.pdf\">annual report</a> for SFSU, a February 2015 <a href=\"http://www.najah.edu/node/34561\">statement</a> on the An-Najah website attested that an memorandum of understanding was signed between An-Najah and SFSU following Abdelhadi’s visit.</p><p>On September 21, 2016, GUPS SFSU <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/GeneralUnionofPalestineStudents/posts/1169669026425600\">posted </a>a <a href=\"https://medium.com/@sfsugups415/gups-statement-of-support-for-sf-states-mou-with-al-najah-university-in-palestine-the-amed-c612dd2ffe3c#.f60vzsxfk\">statement </a>of support for Abdulhadi and the memorandum with An-Najah and condemned pro-Israel organizations for denouncing the partnership. <br></p><h2>Probation for Intimidating Jewish Students</h2><p></p><p>In April 2002, GUPS SFSU students <a href=\"http://www.sfsu.edu/~news/response/summary.htm\">circulated </a>a flyer advertising a pro-Palestinian event entitled: “Genocide in the 21st Century.” Invoking a medieval anti-Semitic blood libel, the flyer featured a dead baby on a soup can label, framed by two Israeli flags and the words “Made in Israel -- Palestinian Children Meat -- Slaughtered According to Jewish Rites Under American License.” <br></p><p>In May of 2002, at the end of a pro-Israel peace rally sponsored by the SFSU Hillel, GUPS SFSU students who had been participating in a counter demonstration <a href=\"http://www.freerepublic.com/focus/news/684040/posts\">surrounded </a>the Hillel students and threatened them verbally and physically.

    "snippet" : "<h2>Overview</h2><p>The International Solidarity Movement (ISM) was founded in 2001 and, according to the group’s <a href=\"https://palsolidarity.org/about/\">website</a>, is “resisting the long-entrenched and systematic oppression and dispossession of the Palestinian population, using non-violent, direct-action methods and principles.”</p><p>Despite this claim of non-violence, the ISM has been accused of<a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/volokh-conspiracy/wp/2015/04/21/is-the-international-solidarity-movement-pro-terrorist-a-response-to-huwaida-arraf/\"> supporting terrorism</a> and has <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20030420214428/http://www.palsolidarity.org/about_us.htm\">encouraged</a> its foreign volunteers to act<a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20030420214428/http://www.palsolidarity.org/about_us.htm\"> “as human shields in cities, towns and refugee camps.”</a> There is at least one known instance of ISM facilities being used in attempts to <a href=\"http://mfa.gov.il/MFA/PressRoom/2003/Pages/Senior%20Islamic%20Jihad%20terrorist%20arrested%20while%20hidi.aspx\">facilitate </a>the escape of known terrorists from Israeli security forces. </p><p>ISM has <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20030420214428/http://www.palsolidarity.org/about_us.htm\">encouraged</a> its volunteers to break curfew and disregard Israeli directives prohibiting access to closed military zones. This policy resulted in the death of ISM operative <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rachel_Corrie\">Rachel Corrie</a>, who was killed by a bulldozer while interfering with an Israeli military operation in 2003. A wrongful death suit brought by Corrie’s family was dismissed when the judge<a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/08/29/world/middleeast/court-rules-israel-wasnt-at-fault-in-rachel-corries-death.html?_r=3&amp;hp\"> ruled</a> that Corrie unreasonably chose to put her own life in danger and found there to be no intent or negligence on the part of any Israelis involved in the incident.</p><p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Solidarity_Movement\">According </a>to Israel's Ministry of Foreign Affairs, some ISM activities are carried out \"under the auspices of Palestinian terrorist organizations” and a senior IDF officer has <a href=\"https://books.google.com/books?id=bza9CQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA108&amp;lpg=PA108&amp;dq=%22But,+as+far+as+we+are+concerned,+ISM+is+not+an+international+organization+or+a+peace+organization.+It%27s+a+pro-Palestinian+organization,+set+up+by+Palestinians,+funded+by+Palestinians+and+linked+to+Palestinian+terror%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=qQg8FS1x9l&amp;sig=1WB-UMBl3G0Fv_MvmrgZeajEUyk&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwit1bnS_9rSAhWHwlQKHZ1xDIcQ6AEIGjAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22But%2C%20as%20far%20as%20we%20are%20concerned%2C%20ISM%20is%20not%20an%20international%20organization%20or%20a%20peace%20organization.%20It%27s%20a%20pro-Palestinian%20organization%2C%20set%20up%20by%20Palestinians%2C%20funded%20by%20Palestinians%20and%20linked%20to%20Palestinian%20terror%22&amp;f=false\">said </a>that ISM is \"a pro-Palestinian organization, set up by Palestinians, funded by Palestinians and linked to Palestinian terror.”</p><h2>Background</h2><p>ISM was <a href=\"http://friedensbewegung.zionismus.info/gemeinsam/andoni.htm\">founded </a>in <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Solidarity_Movement\">2001 </a>during the second intifada, by <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghassan_Andoni\">Ghassan Andoni</a>, a leader of the <a href=\"https://canarymission.org/organization/Popular_Front_For_The_Liberation_Of_Palestine\">Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP)</a>, Israeli anti-Zionist activist Neta Golan, Palestinian-American activist <a href=\"https://canarymission.org/individual/Huwaida_Arraf\">Huwaida Arraf</a>, as well as Palestinian Christians George Qassis and George N. Rishmawi. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adam_Shapiro_(activist)\">Adam Shapiro</a>, Arraf’s Jewish husband,  joined the movement shortly after its founding and is also often considered to be one of the founders.<br></p><p></p><h2>Non-Violence in Conjunction with Violence</h2><br>ISM <a href=\"https://palsolidarity.org/about/faq/\">declares </a>that it functions “using nonviolent direct-action and other forms of unarmed resistance as a method for confronting and challenging the Israeli occupation.” Yet in 2002, during the second Intifada, ISM co-founders Arraf and Shapiro wrote <a href=\"http://netwmd.com/anti-ism/ISM%20by%20any%20means.htm\">an article</a> for the Palestine Chronicle explaining that nonviolent direct action must be an additional tactic along with terrorism, not as a replacement for it. <p></p><p>Arraf and Shapiro wrote: “The Palestinian resistance must take on a variety of characteristics — both nonviolent and violent. But most importantly it must develop a strategy involving both aspects. No other successful nonviolent movement was able to achieve what it did without a concurrent violent movement.” </p><p>The article continued: “In actuality, nonviolence is not enough. Rather, what is needed is nonviolent direct action against the occupation. This includes roadblock removal, boycotts, refusing to obey curfew orders, blocking roads, refusing to show ID cards or even burning them.”</p><p></p><h2>ISM Founders Condoning Terrorism</h2><p></p><p>In July of 2003, in an interview with the Jordan Star, ISM co-founder Shapiro <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20030727203927/http://star.arabia.com/article/0,5596,290_8957,00.html\">reportedly </a>“justifies the Palestinian armed resistance against Israel as long as it is targeting Israeli soldiers and Jewish settlers in the West Bank and Gaza Strip. Otherwise, he is not in favor of suicide bombings.”</p><p>On February 23, 2003, Saif Abu Keshek, the co-ordinator for the ISM in Nablus, <a href=\"http://jat-action.org/ISM_essay_ref05.htm\">declared </a>in an interview that “there is support for the armed resistance. It is one of the rights of the Palestinians to fight back against the occupation”.</p><p>Abu Keshek further clarified that although the ISM supports non violent direct action, not armed struggle, they “recognise the right of the Palestinians to choose their way of resistance.”<br></p><p>On October 7, 2002, ISM co-founder Andoni said in an <a href=\"http://friedensbewegung.zionismus.info/gemeinsam/andoni.htm\">interview </a>that “Palestinians have the full right to resist the occupation with means that they think are suitable.” </p><p>Joe Carr, ISM’s local coordinator in Rafah in early 2003 — when Rachel Corrie was killed — <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20050507025029/http://www.lovinrevolution.org/Bio.htm\">explains</a>, “I find nonviolent tactics powerful and effective, but violence &amp; property destruction have been and always will be an essential part of revolutionary movements.”</p><p></p><h2>Funding</h2>ISM does not <a href=\"http://www.terrorism-info.org.il/data/pdf/PDF_10_278_2.pdf\">receive </a>government funding and its volunteers pay their expenses out of pocket (except for large projects like the IHH-led flotilla, in which ISM activists were part of a coalition that took advantage of Turkey's political capabilities). <p></p><p></p><h2>Volunteers as Human Shields</h2>Rishmawi <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/02/11/AR2006021101014.html\">told </a>the San Francisco Chronicle in a July 14, 2004 news story why ISM recruits student volunteers. “When Palestinians get shot by Israeli soldiers, no one is interested anymore,” he said. “But if some of these foreign volunteers get shot or even killed, then the international media will sit up and take notice.” <p></p><p>In the 2002 article, Shapiro and Arraf <a href=\"http://netwmd.com/anti-ism/ISM%20by%20any%20means.htm\">predicted </a>that “yes, people will get killed and injured” in the course of their volunteering with the ISM and suggested that the casualties “would be considered shaheed.”<br></p><p>ISM has arranged for members to <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20030420214428/http://www.palsolidarity.org/about_us.htm\">act </a>as “human shields” for Palestinians during military incursions, hindering Israeli soldiers’ movements and placing the soldiers and themselves in grave danger.</p><p>At a <a href=\"http://docplayer.net/37443290-The-meir-amit-intelligence-and-terrorism-information-center.html\">training </a>session in 2004, ISM activists were instructed how to act as human shields. The trainers advised that in instances where ISM activists were unable to help Palestinians circumvent checkpoints by distracting the Israeli guards, they (ISM) should act as “human shields for Palestinians.”</p><p>As one ISM <a href=\"http://docplayer.net/37443290-The-meir-amit-intelligence-and-terrorism-information-center.html\">trainer </a>put it: “Soldiers will be less likely to shoot or use violence when Westerners are present. Usually, they [the ISM activists] also carry a camera or video camera, because filming soldiers often makes them leave...”<br></p><p>During the second intifada, ISM <a href=\"http://www.terrorism-info.org.il/data/pdf/PDF_10_278_2.pdf\">sent </a>activists to serve as human shields at the entrances to the Church of the Nativity in Bethlehem and to Arafat's headquarters in Ramallah</p><p>In the spring of 2002, 40 senior terrorist leaders <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2002/WORLD/meast/05/02/bethlehem.standoff/index.html\">took refuge</a> in the Church of the Nativity in Bethlehem. The IDF laid siege to the church but a dozen ISM members snuck past the soldiers to provide support to the terrorists. </p><p>In April 2002, during Operation Defensive Shield, <a href=\"http://www.haaretz.com/adam-s-rift-1.48135\">Shapiro</a>, Golan and other ISM activists served as <a href=\"http://www.terrorism-info.org.il/data/pdf/PDF_10_278_2.pdf\">human shields</a> around Arafat's presidential compound (the Muqata'a) in Ramallah. Shapiro remained for 24 hours, helping Arafat with public relations. <br><br>On October 26, 2003, The Los Angeles Times <a href=\"http://articles.latimes.com/2003/oct/26/news/adfn-shield26/2\">reported </a>that Brian Avery, an ISM activist injured in Israel, sent his family an email shortly before he was wounded explaining that ...the group’s main “actions” ... consisted of “being monitors and witnesses at military checkpoints” and “lodging in the homes of the families of individuals who chose suicide bombing as their method of resisting the occupation.” (Oct. 26, 2003)<br><br>ISM’s policy of <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20030420214428/http://www.palsolidarity.org/about_us.htm\">intentionally </a>placing international volunteers as human shields resulted in the death of Rachel Corrie in 2003 and Tom Hurndall killed in 2004.</p><p>During a memorial held in her honor, a Hamas activist <a href=\"http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2006/11/13/idealism-gone-astray-the-play-that/\">said </a>of Corrie: “Her death serves me more than it served her. Going in front of the tanks was heroic. Her death will bring more attention than the other 2,000 martyrs.”<br></p><p></p><h2>Supporting Armed Struggle</h2><br>ISM refuses to condemn Palestinian violence, even against civilians. In its <a href=\"https://palsolidarity.org/about/faq/#support\">mission statement</a>, ISM states that, for Palestinians, “armed struggle\" is \"their right.” “Violent” resistance was defined in the article as “when an armed Palestinian fighter shoots an Israeli who is oppressing him.” <br><br>ISM <a href=\"https://palsolidarity.org/about/faq/\">defends </a>the Palestinians’ right to use violence, <a href=\"http://www.liquisearch.com/international_solidarity_movement/philosophy/isms_position_on_violence\">noting</a>, “we recognize the Palestinian right to resist Israeli violence and occupation via legitimate armed struggle. However, we believe that nonviolence can be a powerful weapon in fighting oppression and we are committed to the principles of nonviolent resistance.”<p></p><p>On June 1, 2016, ISM <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/ismpalestine/photos/a.10150180262329145.304534.56674479144/10153885585444145/?type=3&amp;theater\">posted </a>an article to Facebook condemning Israel for charging Professor Imad Barghouthi, a Palestinian astrophysicist, with incitement. Barghouthi was <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/middle-east/israel-palestine-incitement-facebook-professor-imad-barghouth-a7362106.html\">sentenced</a> to prison for seven months for incitement to violence.</p><p>Barghouti is a vocal <a href=\"http://www.memri.org/tv/palestinian-astrophysics-professor-imad-barghouthi-urges-development-missiles-archival\">supporter </a>of Hamas’s military wing, the Izz ad-Din al-Qassam Brigades, and has called for killing and being killed in the name of Islam</p><p>An October 22, 2014 <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/memri.org/videos/10154190511739717/\">video</a> showed Barghouthi, at an Al-Quds university <a href=\"https://canarymission.org/organization/Hamas\">Hamas</a> rally, draped in a Hamas banner, urging students to design precision guided missiles (0:33), and sniper rifles as “weapons of  the resistance” (1:11) to kill “zionist soldiers” in their bedrooms. (2:35)</p><h2>Collaborating with Terrorists</h2><p>Arraf has stated on <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/02/16/AR2006021602027_2.html\">record</a> that ISM <a href=\"http://www.stoptheism.com/content/index.php?pid=1&amp;cid=14\">works</a> collaboratively with <a href=\"https://canarymission.org/organization/Hamas\">Hamas</a>, <a href=\"http://archive.adl.org/terrorism/symbols/palestinian_islamic_jihad.html\">Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ)</a> and the PFLP, all of which have been designated as terrorist groups by the American State Department. Those organizations use violent means, while the ISM works with these organization providing non-violent direct action and support, including blocking the progress of Israeli soldiers attempting to apprehend terrorists. An <a href=\"http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2003/09/death-rachel-corrie\">article </a>in Mother Jones described ISM as “Embracing Palestinian militants, even suicide bombers, as freedom fighters.” <br><br>On March 27, 2003, Shadi Sukiya, a senior PIJ member involved in the planning of several thwarted suicide attacks, was <a href=\"https://palsolidarity.org/about/faq/\">arrested </a>while hiding in an ISM office in the West Bank. The ISM website has stated that Sukiya “appeared at the ISM office in Jenin in the middle of the night. He was soaking wet, shivering and terrified. The ISM members present did not speak sufficient Arabic and Sukiya spoke no English.”</p><p>ISM members, however, <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/middleeast/israel/1451730/The-peace-group-that-embraces-violence.html\">allegedly </a>tried to prevent Israeli security forces from searching their Jenin office. </p><p>Susan Barclay, the ISM organizer who <a href=\"http://www.seattlepi.com/news/article/Activist-s-death-focuses-spotlight-on-Mideast-1110154.php\">hid</a> Sukiya, told the Seattle Post Intelligencer that, “she knowingly worked with representatives from Hamas and Islamic Jihad -- terrorist groups that sponsor suicide bombings and exist, according to their charters, to demolish the Jewish state entirely.” </p><p>Shadi Sukiya was <a href=\"http://www.terrorism-info.org.il/data/pdf/PDF_10_278_2.pdf\">convicted</a> for, among other charges, facilitating the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karkur_junction_suicide_bombing\">Karkur Junction bombing attack</a>, killing 14 passengers and wounding 50 passengers.</p><p>Another two terrorists who carried out an attack were reported to potentially be tied to ISM. On April 30, 2003, Asif Muhammad Hanif was responsible for killing three people and wounding more than 50 in a suicide bombing at Mike’s Place bar in Tel Aviv. Five days earlier, he and his collaborator Omar Khan Sharif were among a group <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/middleeast/israel/1451730/The-peace-group-that-embraces-violence.html\">hosted </a>by ISM members at their Gaza apartment. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2003/may/02/terrorism.israel\">According </a>to the May 2, 2003 <i>Guardian</i>, “the Britons who mounted the suicide attacks in Israel attempted to join the peace movement as cover for their activities.”</p><p></p><h2>Supporting Terrorists</h2>On March 3, 2017, ISM <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ISMPalestine/status/837648761845387264\">published </a>an article on Twitter as well as <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/ismpalestine/posts/10154660120409145\">posting </a>on their facebook page,  calling for justice for <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muhammad_al-Qiq\">Mohammed al-Qiq</a>. In February of 2017, ISM <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/ismpalestine/posts/10154636125964145\">posted </a><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/ismpalestine/posts/10154627899774145\">several </a>articles on behalf of al-Qiq on their facebook page. ISM refers to al-Qiq as a journalist, neglecting to mention his role as a <a href=\"https://canarymission.org/organization/Hamas\">Hamas</a> militant who has been placed under administrative detention for his terror-related activities. <br><br>On January 6, 2017, ISM <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/ismpalestine/posts/10154500775729145\">called </a>on facebook for “Days of Action to Free <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ahmad_Sa%27adat\">Ahmad Sa’adat</a>,” the General Secretary of the the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Popular_Front_For_The_Liberation_Of_Palestine\">Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP)</a>.<br><p></p><p>Sa’adat was elected the General secretary of the PFLP in 2001. The PFLP, founded by <a href=\"http://content.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,1707366,00.html\">George Habash</a>, is designated <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Popular_Front_For_The_Liberation_Of_Palestine\">a terrorist organization</a> by the European Union, Canada, The United States and Israel. Sa'adat was found guilty and incarcerated for organizing the 2001 assassination of Israeli Tourism Minister <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rehavam_Ze%27evi\">Rehavam Ze'evi</a>.</p><p>On December 17, 2016, ISM <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ISMPalestine/status/810258277955235840\">tweeted </a>a statement from Rasmea Odeh’s defense committee. On December 30, 2016, ISM <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/ismpalestine/posts/10154479224529145\">posted </a>on facebook call to assist in the defense of Odeh during a retrial.<br><br>Odeh was a <a href=\"http://legalinsurrection.com/2014/11/rasmea-odeh-rightly-convicted-of-israeli-supermarket-bombing-and-u-s-immigration-fraud/\">military operative </a>with the<a href=\"http://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-30099510\"> PFLP</a>. In 1969, she masterminded a <a href=\"http://www.jta.org/1969/02/24/archive/jerusalem-supersol-re-opens-for-business-2-young-bombing-victims-are-buried\">bombing</a> that killed two university students in a Jerusalem supermarket. Odeh also attempted to bomb the British consulate.</p><p>Odeh confessed, in a highly detailed <a href=\"https://www.scribd.com/document/288292022/Rasmieh-Odeh-Case-March-1-and-7-1969-Ramieh-Confessions-Exh-I-to-Govt-Response-to-Motion-for-Reconsideration-of-Bond-Revocation\">account</a>, the day following her arrest. In a 2004 documentary, one of Odeh’s co-conspirators <a href=\"https://youtu.be/kfGhHu6VYlE?t=44\">directly implicated</a> her as the mastermind.</p><p>In 1970, an Israeli court tried and convicted Odeh for her involvement in both bombings and sentenced her to life imprisonment. However, Odeh was released 10 years later, in a prisoner swap and emigrated to the United States.&nbsp;<br></p><p>In January 2013, the ISM website <a href=\"http://palsolidarity.org/2013/01/meeting-samer-al-issawi-in-the-holding-room/\">published</a> a sympathetic article on Sammer Issawi, containing no acknowledgement of, much less disapproval of, his terrorist activities. In March, it <a href=\"http://palsolidarity.org/2013/03/statement-from-samer-issawi-who-has-spent-over-240-days-on-hunger-strike/\">posted</a> a statement from him on their website.<br><br>Issawi is a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/mar/03/palestinian-hunger-striker-uk-israel-sanctions\">member </a>of the<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Front_for_the_Liberation_of_Palestine\"> Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine (DFLP)</a> who <a href=\"http://www.timesofisrael.com/palestinian-inmate-who-fasted-for-266-days-to-be-freed-monday/\">received </a>a 26 year prison sentence in 2002. During the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civilian_casualties_in_the_Second_Intifada\">second intifada</a> he manufactured and distributed pipe bombs and, in several incidents, fired indiscriminately on Israeli civilian vehicles. <br><br>In December 2013, the Israeli <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hadash\">Hadash </a>Party <a href=\"http://www.algemeiner.com/2013/12/27/israeli-arab-political-partys-facebook-page-airs-released-terrorists-call-to-kidnap-idf-soldiers/\">posted </a>on its official Arabic Facebook page an interview where Issawi called for the kidnapping of Israelis: “We want the release of the prisoners. The prisoners' release will be brought about by kidnapping and [prisoner] exchanges. Nothing will happen without that.”<br></p><h2>Defending Incitement</h2><br>On February 19, 2017, ISM posted on Facebook an article about<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raed_Salah\"> Sheikh Raed Salah </a>being barred from travel abroad or entering Jerusalem for five months. The <a href=\"http://samidoun.net/2017/02/sheikh-raed-salah-banned-from-travel-abroad-or-entering-jerusalem-for-five-more-months/?utm_source=dlvr.it&amp;utm_medium=twitter\">article </a>noted that although Salah is the leader of the Islamic Movement in Israel, and in 2015, the Israeli state <a href=\"http://samidoun.net/2016/10/palestinian-institutions-in-nazareth-and-umm-al-fahm-raided-and-closed-by-israeli-forces/\">banned </a>the Islamic Movement, the ban was “condemned by Palestinian organizations across the political spectrum as an attack on all Palestinians in ’48 Palestine [pre-1967 Israel], who hold Israeli citizenship.”<br><br>Salah, leader of the extreme wing of the Islamic Movement in Israel, has <a href=\"http://leftfootforward.org/2015/06/an-open-letter-to-jeremy-corbyn/\">endorsed</a> <a href=\"http://www.snopes.com/rumors/israel.asp\">the conspiracy theory</a> that was <a href=\"http://www.nationalreview.com/article/222127/jews-knew-anne-morse\">started</a> by Syria’s government-owned newspaper, Al Thawra, about Jews being warned not to come to work at the World Trade Center on September 11, 2001. In a 2007 sermon, Salah also <a href=\"http://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/.premium-1.715121\">employed</a> the medieval European blood libel that Jews use the blood of gentile children to make matzah for Passover. <br><h2>Free Gaza Movement (FGM)</h2><p></p><p>ISM’s most ambitious campaign has been the <a href=\"http://www.freegaza.org/\">Free Gaza Movement (FGM)</a>, <a href=\"http://www.terrorism-info.org.il/data/pdf/PDF_10_278_2.pdf\">launched </a>by ISM founders Huwaida Arraf and Adam Shapiro, together with Greta Berlin and US-based ISM coordinator Paul Larudee. FGM states on their website that their goal is “to break the Israel’s illegal siege on Gaza’s 1.8 million civilians” by “direct action… using non-violent means.” <br><br>Much of FGM's early success can be <a href=\"http://www.adl.org/assets/pdf/israel-international/Free-Gaza-Movement-NW.pdf\">attributed </a>to the ISM’s active participation. In advance of and during the first several missions to Gaza, ISM made its media team available to FGM and posted FGM press releases on its own site. As a result, FGM was able to reach an established audience of ISM activists and supporters.<br><br>The ISM’s involvement in the flotillas was made clear by a leadership overlap and the participation of those leaders in organizing and public relations efforts for the flotillas, as well as the participation of its activists in the flotillas themselves. Most notably, Huwaida Arraf, an ISM co-founder who <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huwaida_Arraf\">served </a>as FGM's chairperson until 2012. Arraf was <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_flotilla_raid\">aboard </a>the 2008 Free Gaza flotillla, as well as the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ships_of_Gaza_flotilla_raid\">2010 flotilla</a> that was<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_flotilla_raid\"> raided</a> by Israeli commandos on May 31 of that year.<br><br>FGM <a href=\"http://www.freegaza.org/\">states </a>on its website that its activists are committed to “direct action in confronting Israel’s abuse of Palestinians using non-violent means.” <br><br>But FGM's May 2010 flotilla, <a href=\"https://www.adl.org/sites/default/files/documents/assets/pdf/israel-international/Free-Gaza-Movement-NW.pdf\">organized</a><a href=\"http://archive.adl.org/main_anti_israel/international_solidarity_movement.html#.WL56czt95hE\"> </a>by Arraf in conjunction with the pro-Hamas Turkish <a href=\"http://archive.adl.org/main_Terrorism/IHH_Profile.htm\">Insani Yardim Vakfi (IHH)</a>, was marked by deadly clashes between activists and Israeli security forces.<br></p><p>Activists aboard the flotilla’s lead ship — the Mavi Marmara  — <a href=\"https://youtu.be/20pz72KlHFk?t=360\">agitated </a>for violent confrontation with Israeli soldiers and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b3L7OV414Kk&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=20\">chanted</a> “Khaibar, khaibar ya yahud,” a slogan glorifying the killing of Jews. The protesters refused all instructions to change course and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaiMjAULWn0https://youtu.be/JaiMjAULWn0?t=13\">attacked</a> Israeli forces with iron bars, metal chairs, knives, stun grenades and firearms, rocks and bottles, as soon as they boarded the Marmara.</p><p>The 2011 United Nations’ Palmer Commission report <a href=\"http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/pdf/world/Palmer-Committee-Final-report.pdf\">found</a> that the flotilla agitators <a href=\"https://youtu.be/j4S5i7PbKrE?t=106\">initiated</a> an organized and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaiMjAULWn0\">violent confrontation</a> with Israeli forces. Following the incident, the Mavi Marmara was found to be carrying <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MV_Mavi_Marmara\">no humanitarian aid</a> whatsoever, on board —  only <a href=\"https://youtu.be/JvS9PXZ3RWM?t=40s\">crude weaponry</a>.</p><p>Arraf <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huwaida_Arraf#cite_note-GlobalEx-3\">resigned </a>from this position in October, 2012, following a series of anti-Semitic tweets posted on the official Twitter feed of the Free Gaza Movement.</p>",

    "manualBackupText" : "<h2>Overview</h2><p>The International Solidarity Movement (ISM) was founded in 2001 and, according to the group’s <a href=\"https://palsolidarity.org/about/\">website</a>, is “resisting the long-entrenched and systematic oppression and dispossession of the Palestinian population, using non-violent, direct-action methods and principles.”</p><p>Despite this claim of non-violence, the ISM has been accused of<a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/volokh-conspiracy/wp/2015/04/21/is-the-international-solidarity-movement-pro-terrorist-a-response-to-huwaida-arraf/\"> supporting terrorism</a> and has <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20030420214428/http://www.palsolidarity.org/about_us.htm\">encouraged</a> its foreign volunteers to act<a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20030420214428/http://www.palsolidarity.org/about_us.htm\"> “as human shields in cities, towns and refugee camps.”</a> There is at least one known instance of ISM facilities being used in attempts to <a href=\"http://mfa.gov.il/MFA/PressRoom/2003/Pages/Senior%20Islamic%20Jihad%20terrorist%20arrested%20while%20hidi.aspx\">facilitate </a>the escape of known terrorists from Israeli security forces. </p><p>ISM has <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20030420214428/http://www.palsolidarity.org/about_us.htm\">encouraged</a> its volunteers to break curfew and disregard Israeli directives prohibiting access to closed military zones. This policy resulted in the death of ISM operative <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rachel_Corrie\">Rachel Corrie</a>, who was killed by a bulldozer while interfering with an Israeli military operation in 2003. A wrongful death suit brought by Corrie’s family was dismissed when the judge<a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2012/08/29/world/middleeast/court-rules-israel-wasnt-at-fault-in-rachel-corries-death.html?_r=3&amp;hp\"> ruled</a> that Corrie unreasonably chose to put her own life in danger and found there to be no intent or negligence on the part of any Israelis involved in the incident.</p><p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Solidarity_Movement\">According </a>to Israel's Ministry of Foreign Affairs, some ISM activities are carried out \"under the auspices of Palestinian terrorist organizations” and a senior IDF officer has <a href=\"https://books.google.com/books?id=bza9CQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA108&amp;lpg=PA108&amp;dq=%22But,+as+far+as+we+are+concerned,+ISM+is+not+an+international+organization+or+a+peace+organization.+It%27s+a+pro-Palestinian+organization,+set+up+by+Palestinians,+funded+by+Palestinians+and+linked+to+Palestinian+terror%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=qQg8FS1x9l&amp;sig=1WB-UMBl3G0Fv_MvmrgZeajEUyk&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwit1bnS_9rSAhWHwlQKHZ1xDIcQ6AEIGjAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22But%2C%20as%20far%20as%20we%20are%20concerned%2C%20ISM%20is%20not%20an%20international%20organization%20or%20a%20peace%20organization.%20It%27s%20a%20pro-Palestinian%20organization%2C%20set%20up%20by%20Palestinians%2C%20funded%20by%20Palestinians%20and%20linked%20to%20Palestinian%20terror%22&amp;f=false\">said </a>that ISM is \"a pro-Palestinian organization, set up by Palestinians, funded by Palestinians and linked to Palestinian terror.”</p><h2>Background</h2><p>ISM was <a href=\"http://friedensbewegung.zionismus.info/gemeinsam/andoni.htm\">founded </a>in <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Solidarity_Movement\">2001 </a>during the second intifada, by <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghassan_Andoni\">Ghassan Andoni</a>, a leader of the <a href=\"https://canarymission.org/organization/Popular_Front_For_The_Liberation_Of_Palestine\">Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP)</a>, Israeli anti-Zionist activist Neta Golan, Palestinian-American activist <a href=\"https://canarymission.org/individual/Huwaida_Arraf\">Huwaida Arraf</a>, as well as Palestinian Christians George Qassis and George N. Rishmawi. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adam_Shapiro_(activist)\">Adam Shapiro</a>, Arraf’s Jewish husband,  joined the movement shortly after its founding and is also often considered to be one of the founders.<br></p><p></p><h2>Non-Violence in Conjunction with Violence</h2><br>ISM <a href=\"https://palsolidarity.org/about/faq/\">declares </a>that it functions “using nonviolent direct-action and other forms of unarmed resistance as a method for confronting and challenging the Israeli occupation.” Yet in 2002, during the second Intifada, ISM co-founders Arraf and Shapiro wrote <a href=\"http://netwmd.com/anti-ism/ISM%20by%20any%20means.htm\">an article</a> for the Palestine Chronicle explaining that nonviolent direct action must be an additional tactic along with terrorism, not as a replacement for it. <p></p><p>Arraf and Shapiro wrote: “The Palestinian resistance must take on a variety of characteristics — both nonviolent and violent. But most importantly it must develop a strategy involving both aspects. No other successful nonviolent movement was able to achieve what it did without a concurrent violent movement.” </p><p>The article continued: “In actuality, nonviolence is not enough. Rather, what is needed is nonviolent direct action against the occupation. This includes roadblock removal, boycotts, refusing to obey curfew orders, blocking roads, refusing to show ID cards or even burning them.”</p><p></p><h2>ISM Founders Condoning Terrorism</h2><p></p><p>In July of 2003, in an interview with the Jordan Star, ISM co-founder Shapiro <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20030727203927/http://star.arabia.com/article/0,5596,290_8957,00.html\">reportedly </a>“justifies the Palestinian armed resistance against Israel as long as it is targeting Israeli soldiers and Jewish settlers in the West Bank and Gaza Strip. Otherwise, he is not in favor of suicide bombings.”</p><p>On February 23, 2003, Saif Abu Keshek, the co-ordinator for the ISM in Nablus, <a href=\"http://jat-action.org/ISM_essay_ref05.htm\">declared </a>in an interview that “there is support for the armed resistance. It is one of the rights of the Palestinians to fight back against the occupation”.</p><p>Abu Keshek further clarified that although the ISM supports non violent direct action, not armed struggle, they “recognise the right of the Palestinians to choose their way of resistance.”<br></p><p>On October 7, 2002, ISM co-founder Andoni said in an <a href=\"http://friedensbewegung.zionismus.info/gemeinsam/andoni.htm\">interview </a>that “Palestinians have the full right to resist the occupation with means that they think are suitable.” </p><p>Joe Carr, ISM’s local coordinator in Rafah in early 2003 — when Rachel Corrie was killed — <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20050507025029/http://www.lovinrevolution.org/Bio.htm\">explains</a>, “I find nonviolent tactics powerful and effective, but violence &amp; property destruction have been and always will be an essential part of revolutionary movements.”</p><p></p><h2>Funding</h2>ISM does not <a href=\"http://www.terrorism-info.org.il/data/pdf/PDF_10_278_2.pdf\">receive </a>government funding and its volunteers pay their expenses out of pocket (except for large projects like the IHH-led flotilla, in which ISM activists were part of a coalition that took advantage of Turkey's political capabilities). <p></p><p></p><h2>Volunteers as Human Shields</h2>Rishmawi <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/02/11/AR2006021101014.html\">told </a>the San Francisco Chronicle in a July 14, 2004 news story why ISM recruits student volunteers. “When Palestinians get shot by Israeli soldiers, no one is interested anymore,” he said. “But if some of these foreign volunteers get shot or even killed, then the international media will sit up and take notice.” <p></p><p>In the 2002 article, Shapiro and Arraf <a href=\"http://netwmd.com/anti-ism/ISM%20by%20any%20means.htm\">predicted </a>that “yes, people will get killed and injured” in the course of their volunteering with the ISM and suggested that the casualties “would be considered shaheed.”<br></p><p>ISM has arranged for members to <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20030420214428/http://www.palsolidarity.org/about_us.htm\">act </a>as “human shields” for Palestinians during military incursions, hindering Israeli soldiers’ movements and placing the soldiers and themselves in grave danger.</p><p>At a <a href=\"http://docplayer.net/37443290-The-meir-amit-intelligence-and-terrorism-information-center.html\">training </a>session in 2004, ISM activists were instructed how to act as human shields. The trainers advised that in instances where ISM activists were unable to help Palestinians circumvent checkpoints by distracting the Israeli guards, they (ISM) should act as “human shields for Palestinians.”</p><p>As one ISM <a href=\"http://docplayer.net/37443290-The-meir-amit-intelligence-and-terrorism-information-center.html\">trainer </a>put it: “Soldiers will be less likely to shoot or use violence when Westerners are present. Usually, they [the ISM activists] also carry a camera or video camera, because filming soldiers often makes them leave...”<br></p><p>During the second intifada, ISM <a href=\"http://www.terrorism-info.org.il/data/pdf/PDF_10_278_2.pdf\">sent </a>activists to serve as human shields at the entrances to the Church of the Nativity in Bethlehem and to Arafat's headquarters in Ramallah</p><p>In the spring of 2002, 40 senior terrorist leaders <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2002/WORLD/meast/05/02/bethlehem.standoff/index.html\">took refuge</a> in the Church of the Nativity in Bethlehem. The IDF laid siege to the church but a dozen ISM members snuck past the soldiers to provide support to the terrorists. </p><p>In April 2002, during Operation Defensive Shield, <a href=\"http://www.haaretz.com/adam-s-rift-1.48135\">Shapiro</a>, Golan and other ISM activists served as <a href=\"http://www.terrorism-info.org.il/data/pdf/PDF_10_278_2.pdf\">human shields</a> around Arafat's presidential compound (the Muqata'a) in Ramallah. Shapiro remained for 24 hours, helping Arafat with public relations. <br><br>On October 26, 2003, The Los Angeles Times <a href=\"http://articles.latimes.com/2003/oct/26/news/adfn-shield26/2\">reported </a>that Brian Avery, an ISM activist injured in Israel, sent his family an email shortly before he was wounded explaining that ...the group’s main “actions” ... consisted of “being monitors and witnesses at military checkpoints” and “lodging in the homes of the families of individuals who chose suicide bombing as their method of resisting the occupation.” (Oct. 26, 2003)<br><br>ISM’s policy of <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20030420214428/http://www.palsolidarity.org/about_us.htm\">intentionally </a>placing international volunteers as human shields resulted in the death of Rachel Corrie in 2003 and Tom Hurndall killed in 2004.</p><p>During a memorial held in her honor, a Hamas activist <a href=\"http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2006/11/13/idealism-gone-astray-the-play-that/\">said </a>of Corrie: “Her death serves me more than it served her. Going in front of the tanks was heroic. Her death will bring more attention than the other 2,000 martyrs.”<br></p><p></p><h2>Supporting Armed Struggle</h2><br>ISM refuses to condemn Palestinian violence, even against civilians. In its <a href=\"https://palsolidarity.org/about/faq/#support\">mission statement</a>, ISM states that, for Palestinians, “armed struggle\" is \"their right.” “Violent” resistance was defined in the article as “when an armed Palestinian fighter shoots an Israeli who is oppressing him.” <br><br>ISM <a href=\"https://palsolidarity.org/about/faq/\">defends </a>the Palestinians’ right to use violence, <a href=\"http://www.liquisearch.com/international_solidarity_movement/philosophy/isms_position_on_violence\">noting</a>, “we recognize the Palestinian right to resist Israeli violence and occupation via legitimate armed struggle. However, we believe that nonviolence can be a powerful weapon in fighting oppression and we are committed to the principles of nonviolent resistance.”<p></p><p>On June 1, 2016, ISM <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/ismpalestine/photos/a.10150180262329145.304534.56674479144/10153885585444145/?type=3&amp;theater\">posted </a>an article to Facebook condemning Israel for charging Professor Imad Barghouthi, a Palestinian astrophysicist, with incitement. Barghouthi was <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/middle-east/israel-palestine-incitement-facebook-professor-imad-barghouth-a7362106.html\">sentenced</a> to prison for seven months for incitement to violence.</p><p>Barghouti is a vocal <a href=\"http://www.memri.org/tv/palestinian-astrophysics-professor-imad-barghouthi-urges-development-missiles-archival\">supporter </a>of Hamas’s military wing, the Izz ad-Din al-Qassam Brigades, and has called for killing and being killed in the name of Islam</p><p>An October 22, 2014 <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/memri.org/videos/10154190511739717/\">video</a> showed Barghouthi, at an Al-Quds university <a href=\"https://canarymission.org/organization/Hamas\">Hamas</a> rally, draped in a Hamas banner, urging students to design precision guided missiles (0:33), and sniper rifles as “weapons of  the resistance” (1:11) to kill “zionist soldiers” in their bedrooms. (2:35)</p><h2>Collaborating with Terrorists</h2><p>Arraf has stated on <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/02/16/AR2006021602027_2.html\">record</a> that ISM <a href=\"http://www.stoptheism.com/content/index.php?pid=1&amp;cid=14\">works</a> collaboratively with <a href=\"https://canarymission.org/organization/Hamas\">Hamas</a>, <a href=\"http://archive.adl.org/terrorism/symbols/palestinian_islamic_jihad.html\">Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ)</a> and the PFLP, all of which have been designated as terrorist groups by the American State Department. Those organizations use violent means, while the ISM works with these organization providing non-violent direct action and support, including blocking the progress of Israeli soldiers attempting to apprehend terrorists. An <a href=\"http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2003/09/death-rachel-corrie\">article </a>in Mother Jones described ISM as “Embracing Palestinian militants, even suicide bombers, as freedom fighters.” <br><br>On March 27, 2003, Shadi Sukiya, a senior PIJ member involved in the planning of several thwarted suicide attacks, was <a href=\"https://palsolidarity.org/about/faq/\">arrested </a>while hiding in an ISM office in the West Bank. The ISM website has stated that Sukiya “appeared at the ISM office in Jenin in the middle of the night. He was soaking wet, shivering and terrified.

In March, it <a href=\"http://palsolidarity.org/2013/03/statement-from-samer-issawi-who-has-spent-over-240-days-on-hunger-strike/\">posted</a> a statement from him on their website.<br><br>Issawi is a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/mar/03/palestinian-hunger-striker-uk-israel-sanctions\">member </a>of the<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Front_for_the_Liberation_of_Palestine\"> Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine (DFLP)</a> who <a href=\"http://www.timesofisrael.com/palestinian-inmate-who-fasted-for-266-days-to-be-freed-monday/\">received </a>a 26 year prison sentence in 2002. During the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civilian_casualties_in_the_Second_Intifada\">second intifada</a> he manufactured and distributed pipe bombs and, in several incidents, fired indiscriminately on Israeli civilian vehicles. <br><br>In December 2013, the Israeli <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hadash\">Hadash </a>Party <a href=\"http://www.algemeiner.com/2013/12/27/israeli-arab-political-partys-facebook-page-airs-released-terrorists-call-to-kidnap-idf-soldiers/\">posted </a>on its official Arabic Facebook page an interview where Issawi called for the kidnapping of Israelis: “We want the release of the prisoners. The prisoners' release will be brought about by kidnapping and [prisoner] exchanges. Nothing will happen without that.”<br></p><h2>Defending Incitement</h2><br>On February 19, 2017, ISM posted on Facebook an article about<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raed_Salah\"> Sheikh Raed Salah </a>being barred from travel abroad or entering Jerusalem for five months. The <a href=\"http://samidoun.net/2017/02/sheikh-raed-salah-banned-from-travel-abroad-or-entering-jerusalem-for-five-more-months/?utm_source=dlvr.it&amp;utm_medium=twitter\">article </a>noted that although Salah is the leader of the Islamic Movement in Israel, and in 2015, the Israeli state <a href=\"http://samidoun.net/2016/10/palestinian-institutions-in-nazareth-and-umm-al-fahm-raided-and-closed-by-israeli-forces/\">banned </a>the Islamic Movement, the ban was “condemned by Palestinian organizations across the political spectrum as an attack on all Palestinians in ’48 Palestine [pre-1967 Israel], who hold Israeli citizenship.”<br><br>Salah, leader of the extreme wing of the Islamic Movement in Israel, has <a href=\"http://leftfootforward.org/2015/06/an-open-letter-to-jeremy-corbyn/\">endorsed</a> <a href=\"http://www.snopes.com/rumors/israel.asp\">the conspiracy theory</a> that was <a href=\"http://www.nationalreview.com/article/222127/jews-knew-anne-morse\">started</a> by Syria’s government-owned newspaper, Al Thawra, about Jews being warned not to come to work at the World Trade Center on September 11, 2001. In a 2007 sermon, Salah also <a href=\"http://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/.premium-1.715121\">employed</a> the medieval European blood libel that Jews use the blood of gentile children to make matzah for Passover. <br><h2>Free Gaza Movement (FGM)</h2><p></p><p>ISM’s most ambitious campaign has been the <a href=\"http://www.freegaza.org/\">Free Gaza Movement (FGM)</a>, <a href=\"http://www.terrorism-info.org.il/data/pdf/PDF_10_278_2.pdf\">launched </a>by ISM founders Huwaida Arraf and Adam Shapiro, together with Greta Berlin and US-based ISM coordinator Paul Larudee. FGM states on their website that their goal is “to break the Israel’s illegal siege on Gaza’s 1.8 million civilians” by “direct action… using non-violent means.” <br><br>Much of FGM's early success can be <a href=\"http://www.adl.org/assets/pdf/israel-international/Free-Gaza-Movement-NW.pdf\">attributed </a>to the ISM’s active participation. In advance of and during the first several missions to Gaza, ISM made its media team available to FGM and posted FGM press releases on its own site. As a result, FGM was able to reach an established audience of ISM activists and supporters.<br><br>The ISM’s involvement in the flotillas was made clear by a leadership overlap and the participation of those leaders in organizing and public relations efforts for the flotillas, as well as the participation of its activists in the flotillas themselves. Most notably, Huwaida Arraf, an ISM co-founder who <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huwaida_Arraf\">served </a>as FGM's chairperson until 2012. Arraf was <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_flotilla_raid\">aboard </a>the 2008 Free Gaza flotillla, as well as the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ships_of_Gaza_flotilla_raid\">2010 flotilla</a> that was<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_flotilla_raid\"> raided</a> by Israeli commandos on May 31 of that year.<br><br>FGM <a href=\"http://www.freegaza.org/\">states </a>on its website that its activists are committed to “direct action in confronting Israel’s abuse of Palestinians using non-violent means.” <br><br>But FGM's May 2010 flotilla, <a href=\"https://www.adl.org/sites/default/files/documents/assets/pdf/israel-international/Free-Gaza-Movement-NW.pdf\">organized</a><a href=\"http://archive.adl.org/main_anti_israel/international_solidarity_movement.html#.WL56czt95hE\"> </a>by Arraf in conjunction with the pro-Hamas Turkish <a href=\"http://archive.adl.org/main_Terrorism/IHH_Profile.htm\">Insani Yardim Vakfi (IHH)</a>, was marked by deadly clashes between activists and Israeli security forces.<br></p><p>Activists aboard the flotilla’s lead ship — the Mavi Marmara  — <a href=\"https://youtu.be/20pz72KlHFk?t=360\">agitated </a>for violent confrontation with Israeli soldiers and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b3L7OV414Kk&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=20\">chanted</a> “Khaibar, khaibar ya yahud,” a slogan glorifying the killing of Jews. The protesters refused all instructions to change course and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaiMjAULWn0https://youtu.be/JaiMjAULWn0?t=13\">attacked</a> Israeli forces with iron bars, metal chairs, knives, stun grenades and firearms, rocks and bottles, as soon as they boarded the Marmara.</p><p>The 2011 United Nations’ Palmer Commission report <a href=\"http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/pdf/world/Palmer-Committee-Final-report.pdf\">found</a> that the flotilla agitators <a href=\"https://youtu.be/j4S5i7PbKrE?t=106\">initiated</a> an organized and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaiMjAULWn0\">violent confrontation</a> with Israeli forces. Following the incident, the Mavi Marmara was found to be carrying <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MV_Mavi_Marmara\">no humanitarian aid</a> whatsoever, on board —  only <a href=\"https://youtu.be/JvS9PXZ3RWM?t=40s\">crude weaponry</a>.</p><p>Arraf <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huwaida_Arraf#cite_note-GlobalEx-3\">resigned </a>from this position in October, 2012, following a series of anti-Semitic tweets posted on the official Twitter feed of the Free Gaza Movement.</p>",

Officers from the group have also engaged in hate speech against Jews and Israel. </p><h2><b>Background</b></h2><p>UMD MASC was <a href=\"http://www.dbknews.com/2017/02/10/muslim-political-alliance-student-group/\">founded</a> as the UMD Muslim Political Alliance (UMD MPA) in February of 2017 by two SJP UMD activists — <a href=\"https://canarymission.org/individual/Sarah_Eshera\">Sarah Eshera</a> and <a href=\"https://canarymission.org/individual/Saarah_Javed\">Saarah Javed</a>. </p><p>Within two months of its founding, UMD MASC began to <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/sarah.eshera/posts/1298085513573691\">campaign</a> for the BDS movement at UMD, alongside SJP UMD. Two of UMD MASC’s first four <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/pg/UMDMPA/events/\">events</a> were <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/events/1912662085668862/\">events</a> demonizing Israel, <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/events/1686626741355228/\">co-hosted</a> by SJP UMD.</p><p>On February 12, 2017, UMD’s student newspaper <a href=\"http://www.dbknews.com/2017/02/10/muslim-political-alliance-student-group/\">reported </a>on UMD MASC’s launch: “A new campus organization at UMD aims to give a political voice to Muslim students.”</p><p>On August 3, 2017, UMD MPA <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/UMDMASC/posts/1747287942230995\">re-branded </a>itself as UMD MASC. </p><h2><b>Hate Speech From Leadership</b></h2><p>UMD MASC’s mission statement <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/groups/153176741852404/\">states</a>: “MASC is a safe place for all students with marginalized identities, both within and outside the Muslim community” and went on to say “we welcome all students regardless of their religion, race, sexual orientation, individual identity, and experience.”  </p><p>However, two founding officers of the group tweeted attacks on Jews and Israel during the year before they assumed formal roles with UMD MASC.</p><p>On December 18, 2016, <a href=\"https://canarymission.org/individual/Alawi_Masud\">Alawi Masud</a>, UMD MASC’s public relations chair, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/alawialawiolawi/status/810666793983442945\">tweeted</a>: “hitler was a baddy [a bad man] wym [what do you mean?] the only thing hotter than him were his camps.” </p><p>On April 10, 2016, <a href=\"https://canarymission.org/individual/Sarah_Eshera\">Sarah Eshera</a>, UMD MASC’s president, <a href=\"https://www.evensi.us/israel-fest-2016-mckeldin-mall/174699118\">trolled</a> the “comments” section of a <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/MarylandJSU/\">UMD Jewish Student Union (Maryland JSU)</a> announcement for Israel Fest, an event “celebrating the culture, history and people of Israel.” </p><p>Eshera <a href=\"https://www.evensi.us/israel-fest-2016-mckeldin-mall/174699118\">commented</a>: “Wow!! I didn't realize an apartheid state that runs the largest open air prison was something to be celebrated … As an Arab student, will I be able to cross the mall to get to my class in Jimenez without being harassed? Because that is definitely what would happen in Israel and if the goal is to show Israeli culture, then surely we don’t want to misrepresent it.” </p><h2><b>UMD MASC - Building Off of SJP Activism</b></h2><p>On February 2, 2017, SJP UMD activist Sarah Eshera (also UMD MASC’s <a href=\"https://twitter.com/UMD_MPA/status/847885058341994497\">founder</a> and president) <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/groups/153176741852404/admins/\">created</a> the UMD MASC Facebook group.  </p><p>That same day, SJP UMD activist Saarah Javed and Eshera <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10154611899963600&amp;set=pb.560448599.-2207520000.1492932989.&amp;type=3&amp;theater\">announced</a> the launch of UMD MASC.

The “boycott” rally was <a href=\"http://www.dbknews.com/2017/05/03/israel-fest-umd-sjp-boycott/\">timed </a>to coincide with “Israel Fest” — an annual Israeli cultural event held at UMD, on Israeli Independence Day. The groups called the annual celebration of Israel’s independence on campus “unnecessary” and “insulting.”</p><p>UMD MASC and SJP UMD called for a “Mass Boycott of Israel Fest” and stated in their letter: “Our efforts may be wrongly confused with anti-Semitism, but we urge those who conflate this action with that sentiment to rethink the accusation … It is the country and its discriminatory policies that we oppose, and not the Jewish people.” </p><p>The letter said that Israel is “undeniably responsible for the displacement, imprisonment, and killing of thousands of Palestinians.” The letter added that Israel was an “apartheid state” that was “founded on the forced displacement of thousands of individuals” and that Israel was “the very country responsible for their suffering.”</p><p>UMD MASC and SJP UMD went on to demand that UMD’s <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/MarylandJSU\">Jewish Student Union (Maryland JSU)</a>, the festival <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/events/1271054356324432/\">organizer</a>, prove that the event is “in fact a celebration of Jewish culture.” They also demanded that Maryland JSU change the festival’s name and remove tables promoting Birthright Israel and the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel_Defense_Forces\">Israel Defense Forces (IDF)</a>. </p><p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birthright_Israel\">Birthright Israel</a> is a series of Jewish heritage trips to Israel for Jewish young adults from the United States, Canada and other countries around the world.</p><p>UMD MASC and SJP UMD ended their letter, stating: “We urge you to stand with Muslim and Arab Terps as their allies.

Is that wrong?...”</p><p>The April 18, 2017 event was originally <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/events/1912662085668862/\">billed</a> as “A Conversation with <a href=\"https://canarymission.org/individual/Yousef_Munayyer\">Yousef Munayyer</a>.” Munayyer is the <a href=\"http://uscpr.org/about-us/staff/\">Executive Director</a> of the<a href=\"https://canarymission.org/organization/US_Campaign_For_Palestinian_Rights\"> U.S. Campaign for Palestinian Rights (USCPR)</a>, formerly the <a href=\"http://www.endtheoccupation.org/\">U.S. Campaign to End the Israeli Occupation (ETO)</a>.</p><p>However, on April 16, 2017, UMD MASC <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/events/1912662085668862/permalink/1919687221633015/\">wrote </a>on the Facebook event page that Munayyer could not attend and that “in his place we will have Taher Herzallah from American Muslims for Palestine. We're so happy to be hosting him!”</p><h2><b>UMD MASC and SJP UMD - Demonizing Israel </b></h2><p>On February 26, 2017, SJP UMD <a href=\"https://twitter.com/UMD_SJP/status/836007199444992002\">released</a> an online <a href=\"https://www.change.org/p/president-loh-and-the-sga-support-boycott-divestment-and-sanctions-at-umd\">petition</a>, titled “OFFICIAL STATEMENT ON BDS,” addressed to the UMD SGA and UMD President, Wallace Loh. The petition was circulated in anticipation of the anti-Israel divestment bill that was co-authored by UMD MASC and SJP UMD and <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/sarah.eshera/posts/1298085513573691\">announced</a> on Facebook by Sarah Eshera — UMD MASC <a href=\"https://twitter.com/UMD_MPA/status/847885058341994497\">founder</a> and SJP UMD activist, on April 10, 2017.</p><p>The petition alleged that Israel committed murder and claimed: “Innocent children are forced from their homes to make room for Israeli settlers.” The petition also condemned Israeli checkpoints, which were <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.ca/mike-fegelman/israeli-checkpoint_b_4732358.html\">built</a> to stop <a href=\"https://youtu.be/sA41rfWLqIs?t=13s\">suicide bombings</a> and other terror attacks. </p><p>The petition also cast Israel in the role of apartheid South Africa and stated: “In 1989, our university boldly stood against South African apartheid by divesting from the institutions which supported racist policies in that country. Our goal is to have our university take a strong stand against injustice again.”</p><h2><b>UMD MASC and SJP UMD - Misrepresenting BDS</b></h2><p>SJP UMD’s online  February 26, 2017, BDS <a href=\"https://www.change.org/p/president-loh-and-the-sga-support-boycott-divestment-and-sanctions-at-umd\">petition</a>, mentioned above, concluded with a <a href=\"https://al-shabaka.org/briefs/bds-global-movement-freedom-justice/\">paraphrased</a> 2010 quote from BDS’ founder, <a href=\"https://canarymission.org/individual/Omar_Barghouti\">Omar Barghouti</a>: “The global BDS movement for Palestinian rights presents a progressive, antiracist, sophisticated, sustainable, moral, and effective form of nonviolent civil resistance to apartheid.”  </p><p>Barghouti’s original quote spoke of “resistance for Palestinian human rights,” only.  SJP UMD replaced that phrase with “resistance to apartheid.” The petition also prefaced its paraphrased Barghouti quote with the statement: “To ensure the safety and equality of Palestinians is to ensure the safety and equality of all.” </p><p>However, as early as December 13, 2003, Barghouti <a href=\"http://www.counterpunch.org/2003/12/12/relative-humanity-the-essential-obstacle-to-a-just-peace-in-palestine/\">made clear</a> that his goal is to create a “unitary state, where, by definition, Jews will be a minority.”</p><p>On May 31, 2009, Barghouti also <a href=\"https://electronicintifada.net/content/boycotts-work-interview-omar-barghouti/8263\">said</a>: “I am completely and categorically against binationalism because it assumes that there are two nations with equal moral claims to the land and therefore, we have to accommodate both national rights.”</p><p>SJP UMD’s online <a href=\"https://www.change.org/p/president-loh-and-the-sga-support-boycott-divestment-and-sanctions-at-umd\">petition</a> concluded with a core BDS demand, stating: “As proponents of BDS, we call for Israel to respect the right of Palestinian refugees to return to their home country from which they are currently exiled, as stipulated by UN Resolution 194.” </p><p>The BDS movement’s selective appeal to U.N General Assembly <a href=\"https://unispal.un.org/DPA/DPR/unispal.nsf/0/C758572B78D1CD0085256BCF0077E51A\">Resolution 194</a> (Article 11) has been <a href=\"https://youtu.be/iggdO7C70P8?t=16\">discredited</a> as a subterfuge to eliminate Israel. The non-binding resolution made no mention of the refugees’ ethnicity — either Jewish or Arab — indicating it was aimed at all refugees from the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1948_Arab%E2%80%93Israeli_War\">1948 Arab-Israeli War</a>. </p><p>Resolution 194 urged that refugees be allowed to return to their pre-war homes, provided they were “willing to live in peace with their neighbors.” The Arabs <a href=\"https://youtu.be/G5sXjqiOL94?t=1836\">unanimously rejected</a> Resolution 194.  </p>",

Officers from the group have also engaged in hate speech against Jews and Israel. </p><h2><b>Background</b></h2><p>UMD MASC was <a href=\"http://www.dbknews.com/2017/02/10/muslim-political-alliance-student-group/\">founded</a> as the UMD Muslim Political Alliance (UMD MPA) in February of 2017 by two SJP UMD activists — <a href=\"https://canarymission.org/individual/Sarah_Eshera\">Sarah Eshera</a> and <a href=\"https://canarymission.org/individual/Saarah_Javed\">Saarah Javed</a>. </p><p>Within two months of its founding, UMD MASC began to <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/sarah.eshera/posts/1298085513573691\">campaign</a> for the BDS movement at UMD, alongside SJP UMD. Two of UMD MASC’s first four <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/pg/UMDMPA/events/\">events</a> were <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/events/1912662085668862/\">events</a> demonizing Israel, <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/events/1686626741355228/\">co-hosted</a> by SJP UMD.</p><p>On February 12, 2017, UMD’s student newspaper <a href=\"http://www.dbknews.com/2017/02/10/muslim-political-alliance-student-group/\">reported </a>on UMD MASC’s launch: “A new campus organization at UMD aims to give a political voice to Muslim students.”</p><p>On August 3, 2017, UMD MPA <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/UMDMASC/posts/1747287942230995\">re-branded </a>itself as UMD MASC. </p><h2><b>Hate Speech From Leadership</b></h2><p>UMD MASC’s mission statement <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/groups/153176741852404/\">states</a>: “MASC is a safe place for all students with marginalized identities, both within and outside the Muslim community” and went on to say “we welcome all students regardless of their religion, race, sexual orientation, individual identity, and experience.”  </p><p>However, two founding officers of the group tweeted attacks on Jews and Israel during the year before they assumed formal roles with UMD MASC.</p><p>On December 18, 2016, <a href=\"https://canarymission.org/individual/Alawi_Masud\">Alawi Masud</a>, UMD MASC’s public relations chair, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/alawialawiolawi/status/810666793983442945\">tweeted</a>: “hitler was a baddy [a bad man] wym [what do you mean?] the only thing hotter than him were his camps.” </p><p>On April 10, 2016, <a href=\"https://canarymission.org/individual/Sarah_Eshera\">Sarah Eshera</a>, UMD MASC’s president, <a href=\"https://www.evensi.us/israel-fest-2016-mckeldin-mall/174699118\">trolled</a> the “comments” section of a <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/MarylandJSU/\">UMD Jewish Student Union (Maryland JSU)</a> announcement for Israel Fest, an event “celebrating the culture, history and people of Israel.” </p><p>Eshera <a href=\"https://www.evensi.us/israel-fest-2016-mckeldin-mall/174699118\">commented</a>: “Wow!! I didn't realize an apartheid state that runs the largest open air prison was something to be celebrated … As an Arab student, will I be able to cross the mall to get to my class in Jimenez without being harassed? Because that is definitely what would happen in Israel and if the goal is to show Israeli culture, then surely we don’t want to misrepresent it.” </p><h2><b>UMD MASC - Building Off of SJP Activism</b></h2><p>On February 2, 2017, SJP UMD activist Sarah Eshera (also UMD MASC’s <a href=\"https://twitter.com/UMD_MPA/status/847885058341994497\">founder</a> and president) <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/groups/153176741852404/admins/\">created</a> the UMD MASC Facebook group.  </p><p>That same day, SJP UMD activist Saarah Javed and Eshera <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10154611899963600&amp;set=pb.560448599.-2207520000.1492932989.&amp;type=3&amp;theater\">announced</a> the launch of UMD MASC.

Other individuals holding membership in both UMD MASC and SJP UMD participated, including SJP UMD vice president <a href=\"https://canarymission.org/individual/Miranda_Mlilo\">Miranda Mlilo</a>, and SJP UMD activists <a href=\"https://canarymission.org/individual/Delia_Dreher\">Delia Dreher</a> and <a href=\"https://canarymission.org/individual/Laila_Abujuma\">Laila Abujuma</a>.</p><p>At the rally, Eshera participated in the <a href=\"https://youtu.be/8N6gzCkEmn8?t=89\">chant</a> “Netanyahu what do you say, how many kids did you kill today?” and the <a href=\"https://youtu.be/8N6gzCkEmn8?t=121\">chant</a> “when people are occupied, resistance is justified.” Both chants were led by leading SJP UMD activist <a href=\"https://canarymission.org/individual/Mohammad-Sajjad_Soltanmohammadi\">Mohammad Sajjad Soltanmohammadi</a> — a supporter of <a href=\"http://www.cfr.org/lebanon/hezbollah-k-hizbollah-hizbullah/p9155\">Hezbollah</a> and <a href=\"https://canarymission.org/organization/Hamas\">Hamas</a> — outside McKeldin Library at the beginning of the rally. </p><p>Javed, after the die-in, <a href=\"https://youtu.be/8N6gzCkEmn8?t=1011\">joined</a> demonstrators chanting against “Israeli Apartheid.”</p><p>During the die-in, students lay on the ground near the Israel Fest participants and blocked student walkways. Several SJP UMD activists <a href=\"https://youtu.be/8N6gzCkEmn8?t=935\">refused</a> police requests to get off the ground and clear the area. Many demonstrators continued to <a href=\"https://youtu.be/8N6gzCkEmn8?t=1106\">occupy</a> the space, in <a href=\"http://www.dbknews.com/2016/04/19/palestine-protest-at-umd-israel-fest/\">defiance</a> of university rules and <a href=\"https://youtu.be/8N6gzCkEmn8?t=1022\">engaged </a>in heated <a href=\"https://youtu.be/8N6gzCkEmn8?t=1001\">confrontations</a> with campus police.</p><h2><b>UMD MASC and SJP UMD - Marginalizing UMD Jews for Supporting Israel </b></h2><p>On April 27, 2017, UMD MASC and SJP UMD <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/events/1686626741355228/permalink/1686629914688244/\">posted</a> a co-authored letter on Facebook that promoted an anti-Israel rally at UMD.  The “boycott” rally was <a href=\"http://www.dbknews.com/2017/05/03/israel-fest-umd-sjp-boycott/\">timed </a>to coincide with “Israel Fest” — an annual Israeli cultural event held at UMD, on Israeli Independence Day. The groups called the annual celebration of Israel’s independence on campus “unnecessary” and “insulting.”</p><p>UMD MASC and SJP UMD called for a “Mass Boycott of Israel Fest” and stated in their letter: “Our efforts may be wrongly confused with anti-Semitism, but we urge those who conflate this action with that sentiment to rethink the accusation … It is the country and its discriminatory policies that we oppose, and not the Jewish people.” </p><p>The letter said that Israel is “undeniably responsible for the displacement, imprisonment, and killing of thousands of Palestinians.” The letter added that Israel was an “apartheid state” that was “founded on the forced displacement of thousands of individuals” and that Israel was “the very country responsible for their suffering.”</p><p>UMD MASC and SJP UMD went on to demand that UMD’s <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/MarylandJSU\">Jewish Student Union (Maryland JSU)</a>, the festival <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/events/1271054356324432/\">organizer</a>, prove that the event is “in fact a celebration of Jewish culture.” They also demanded that Maryland JSU change the festival’s name and remove tables promoting Birthright Israel and the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel_Defense_Forces\">Israel Defense Forces (IDF)</a>. </p><p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birthright_Israel\">Birthright Israel</a> is a series of Jewish heritage trips to Israel for Jewish young adults from the United States, Canada and other countries around the world.</p><p>UMD MASC and SJP UMD ended their letter, stating: “We urge you to stand with Muslim and Arab Terps as their allies.

Eshera stated that UMD MASC and SJP UMD jointly introduced the anti-Israel resolution. </p><p>On February 12, 2017, the UMD student newspaper <a href=\"http://www.dbknews.com/2017/02/13/students-justice-palestine-boycott-divest-sanction/\">reported</a> on the launch of the BDS campaign and interviewed SJP UMD’s president, <a href=\"https://canarymission.org/individual/Miranda_Mlilo\">Miranda Mlilo</a>. The newspaper wrote: “Mlilo said SJP doesn't know what organizations this university may be invested in, but that they may file a public records request to find out.”</p><p>As of May 23, 2017, the UMD student newspaper had no reportage about the scheduled divestment vote. </p><h2><b>UMD MASC and SJP UMD - Promoting Anti-Israel Propagandists</b></h2><p>On April 18, 2017, UMD MASC and SJP UMD <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/UMDMPA/photos/gm.1920704221531315/1703962493230207/?type=3&amp;theater\">co-hosted</a> a BDS event featuring <a href=\"https://canarymission.org/individual/Taher_Herzallah\">Taher Herzallah</a> and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/kelhosseiny\">Kareem El Hosseiny</a>, in anticipation of a divestment vote <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/sarah.eshera/posts/1298085513573691\">reportedly</a> scheduled for the the following day. </p><p>Herzallah serves as the Associate Director of Outreach &amp; Grassroots Organizing for <a href=\"https://canarymission.org/organization/American_Muslims_For_Palestine\">American Muslims for Palestine (AMP)</a>.

Is that wrong? What if, as Muslims, we wanted to use violent means to resist occupation? Is that wrong?...”</p><p>The April 18, 2017 event was originally <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/events/1912662085668862/\">billed</a> as “A Conversation with <a href=\"https://canarymission.org/individual/Yousef_Munayyer\">Yousef Munayyer</a>.” Munayyer is the <a href=\"http://uscpr.org/about-us/staff/\">Executive Director</a> of the<a href=\"https://canarymission.org/organization/US_Campaign_For_Palestinian_Rights\"> U.S. Campaign for Palestinian Rights (USCPR)</a>, formerly the <a href=\"http://www.endtheoccupation.org/\">U.S. Campaign to End the Israeli Occupation (ETO)</a>.</p><p>However, on April 16, 2017, UMD MASC <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/events/1912662085668862/permalink/1919687221633015/\">wrote </a>on the Facebook event page that Munayyer could not attend and that “in his place we will have Taher Herzallah from American Muslims for Palestine.

The petition was circulated in anticipation of the anti-Israel divestment bill that was co-authored by UMD MASC and SJP UMD and <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/sarah.eshera/posts/1298085513573691\">announced</a> on Facebook by Sarah Eshera — UMD MASC <a href=\"https://twitter.com/UMD_MPA/status/847885058341994497\">founder</a> and SJP UMD activist, on April 10, 2017.</p><p>The petition alleged that Israel committed murder and claimed: “Innocent children are forced from their homes to make room for Israeli settlers.” The petition also condemned Israeli checkpoints, which were <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.ca/mike-fegelman/israeli-checkpoint_b_4732358.html\">built</a> to stop <a href=\"https://youtu.be/sA41rfWLqIs?t=13s\">suicide bombings</a> and other terror attacks. </p><p>The petition also cast Israel in the role of apartheid South Africa and stated: “In 1989, our university boldly stood against South African apartheid by divesting from the institutions which supported racist policies in that country. Our goal is to have our university take a strong stand against injustice again.”</p><h2><b>UMD MASC and SJP UMD - Misrepresenting BDS</b></h2><p>SJP UMD’s online  February 26, 2017, BDS <a href=\"https://www.change.org/p/president-loh-and-the-sga-support-boycott-divestment-and-sanctions-at-umd\">petition</a>, mentioned above, concluded with a <a href=\"https://al-shabaka.org/briefs/bds-global-movement-freedom-justice/\">paraphrased</a> 2010 quote from BDS’ founder, <a href=\"https://canarymission.org/individual/Omar_Barghouti\">Omar Barghouti</a>: “The global BDS movement for Palestinian rights presents a progressive, antiracist, sophisticated, sustainable, moral, and effective form of nonviolent civil resistance to apartheid.”  </p><p>Barghouti’s original quote spoke of “resistance for Palestinian human rights,” only.  SJP UMD replaced that phrase with “resistance to apartheid.” The petition also prefaced its paraphrased Barghouti quote with the statement: “To ensure the safety and equality of Palestinians is to ensure the safety and equality of all.” </p><p>However, as early as December 13, 2003, Barghouti <a href=\"http://www.counterpunch.org/2003/12/12/relative-humanity-the-essential-obstacle-to-a-just-peace-in-palestine/\">made clear</a> that his goal is to create a “unitary state, where, by definition, Jews will be a minority.”</p><p>On May 31, 2009, Barghouti also <a href=\"https://electronicintifada.net/content/boycotts-work-interview-omar-barghouti/8263\">said</a>: “I am completely and categorically against binationalism because it assumes that there are two nations with equal moral claims to the land and therefore, we have to accommodate both national rights.”</p><p>SJP UMD’s online <a href=\"https://www.change.org/p/president-loh-and-the-sga-support-boycott-divestment-and-sanctions-at-umd\">petition</a> concluded with a core BDS demand, stating: “As proponents of BDS, we call for Israel to respect the right of Palestinian refugees to return to their home country from which they are currently exiled, as stipulated by UN Resolution 194.” </p><p>The BDS movement’s selective appeal to U.N General Assembly <a href=\"https://unispal.un.org/DPA/DPR/unispal.nsf/0/C758572B78D1CD0085256BCF0077E51A\">Resolution 194</a> (Article 11) has been <a href=\"https://youtu.be/iggdO7C70P8?t=16\">discredited</a> as a subterfuge to eliminate Israel. The non-binding resolution made no mention of the refugees’ ethnicity — either Jewish or Arab — indicating it was aimed at all refugees from the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1948_Arab%E2%80%93Israeli_War\">1948 Arab-Israeli War</a>. </p><p>Resolution 194 urged that refugees be allowed to return to their pre-war homes, provided they were “willing to live in peace with their neighbors.” The Arabs <a href=\"https://youtu.be/G5sXjqiOL94?t=1836\">unanimously rejected</a> Resolution 194.  </p>",

During the demonstration, protesters <a href=\"https://youtu.be/k7eOtVD9S0o?t=7m10s\">chanted</a> [00:07:10] “Intifada! Intifada! We support the Intifada!”&nbsp;</div>",

Solidarity with the Palestinian People.”</p><p>During the meeting, Hill <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2018/11/29/media/marc-lamont-hill-cnn/index.html\">reportedly </a>whitewashed Palestinian violence and accused Israel of “state violence and ethnic cleansing.” He also <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2018/11/29/media/marc-lamont-hill-cnn/index.html\">called </a>for a “free Palestine from the river to the sea.”</p><h2>Demonizing Israel and Zionism</h2><p>In <a href=\"https://archive.is/BlzMt\">2019</a>, JVP formally <a href=\"https://jewishvoiceforpeace.org/zionism/\">declared</a> that “the Zionism that took hold and stands today is a settler-colonial movement, establishing an apartheid state.” </p><p>JVP has <a

with Palestinian oppression in Israel, <a href=\"https://mailchi.mp/f3c1d50b26e2/justice-for-george-floyd-3712653\">including</a> U.S. police brutality against black and brown minorities and “violence against Palestinians” in Israel.</p><p>On <a href=\"https://archive.is/6Knr9\">November 24, 2020,</a> JVP <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/CH-3kqugtAc/\">posted</a> on Instagram: “Palestine is a climate justice issue, and anti-Zionism is an environmentalist position.”</p><p>In <a href=\"https://archive.is/nqXDf\">August 2020</a>, following their decision to unionize, JVP <a href=\"https://jewishvoiceforpeace.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/union-public-statement.pdf\">stated</a>: “So often, the goals of the Palestine solidarity movement and the labor movement exist on either side of the same coin — for example, in campaigns to divest from Israeli apartheid and invest in futures where all workers on this land can live with dignity.”</p><p>JVP <a href=\"https://jewishvoiceforpeace.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/union-public-statement.pdf\">continued</a>: “We are excited to contribute to the ongoing work of building international worker solidarity by showing up for other progressive labor unions and encouraging them to do the same for Palestinians.”</p><p>On <a href=\"https://archive.is/HyfUM\">June 4, 2017</a>, five JVP activists

disorderly conduct. The JVP activists <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=10156207130039992&amp;t=65\">infiltrated</a> [00:01:05] and disrupted a contingent of participants from five Jewish LGBTQ organizations that were participating in the parade.</p><p>In a <a href=\"https://archive.is/ebukD\">June 5, 2017</a> interview, then JVP Executive Director <a

href=\"http://www.tabletmag.com/scroll/236292/lgbt-contingent-infiltrated-by-protesters-at-celebrate-israel-parade\">quoted</a> explaining that the LGBTQ group was “a carefully chosen target.\" She also defended the JVP protesters as “a group of queer Jews who feel strongly about gay rights not being used to pinkwash the occupation.\"</p><p>“Pinkwashing” is a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinkwashing_(LGBT)#Israeli_government_public_relations\">claim</a> used by anti-Israel activists to argue that Israel manipulates the LGBTQ community in order to

Munayyer made the unsupported allegation that “more than 35 laws in ostensibly democratic Israel discriminate against Palestinians who are Israeli citizens.”</p><p><a href=\"https://canarymission.org/individual/Ramah_Kudaimi\">Ramah Kudaimi</a>, the <a href=\"http://www.endtheoccupation.org/article.php?id=3063\">Director of Grassroots Organizing</a> for USCPR, has <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ramahkudaimi/status/640250322179506180?lang=en\">promoted </a>incitement to <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ramahkudaimi/status/653348890297499648\">violence </a>against Israelis&nbsp;<a href=\"https://twitter.com/ramahkudaimi/status/334759727441534977\">urged </a>platforms to include Holocaust deniers among mainstream voices and, on July 16, 2016, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ramahkudaimi/status/489597598420852737\">called </a>for the destruction of Israel — tweeting: “F**k Israel every day until the fall of the zionist regime.” Kudaimi, who previously worked for CODEPINK and the <a href=\"http://www.aaan.org/?cat=11\">Arab American Action Network (AAAN)</a> — was one of five USCPR delegates <a href=\"http://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/israel-interrogates-deports-u-s-citizens-pro-palestinian-group-n622671\">denied </a>entry into Israel in July 17, 2016, for security reasons, and banned from entering the country for the next 10 years. </p><p>The <a href=\"http://www.endtheoccupation.org/article.php?id=3063\">National Organizer</a> of USCPR <a href=\"https://canarymission.org/individual/Anna_Baltzer\">Anna Baltzer</a> is heavily <a href=\"http://annainpalestine.blogspot.com/2012/08/meet-me-in-st-louis.html\">involved</a> in church divestment campaigns and <a href=\"http://www.annainthemiddleeast.com/presentations/past/livepresentations/index.html\">travels</a> the world promoting these and other BDS causes. Baltzer has <a href=\"http://www.homelandsecurityus.com/archives/7609\">reportedly</a> propagated unsourced claims which she later recanted. In a July 25, 2014 <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80PY9OK305Q\">interview</a> during <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2014_Israel%E2%80%93Gaza_conflict\">Operation Protective Edge (OPE)</a>, Baltzer denied that Hamas used Palestinian civilians as human shields, despite Hamas <a href=\"http://blogs.channel4.com/factcheck/factcheck-hamas-civilians-human-shields/18534\">openly admitting</a> to the practice several weeks earlier. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXZEzbT0H1s\">(0:18)</a>. Baltzer also referred to Hamas as a “red herring” when asked about how Israel should respond to Hamas provocations (2:00).</p><h2>Attacking Pro-Israel Americans</h2><p>USCPR demonizes pro-Israel Americans by accusing them of improperly influencing U.S. politicians to support their political agenda — USCPR <a href=\"https://org.salsalabs.com/o/641/images/US%20Campaign%20Annual%20Report%20-%202015%20Small.pdf\">wrote </a>(p.8) in its annual 2015 report — “of course the Israel lobby doesn’t limit its advocacy efforts to the federal level. Politicians at the state and even municipal levels are treated to all-expense-paid propaganda trips to Israel, and city and state politicians are pressured to support anti-Palestinian legislation.” </p><p>In March 2015, USCPR <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAlxqZEqJls\">uploaded </a>a short video to Youtube, titled “Bibi’s Bad Advice.” The video <a href=\"https://youtu.be/tAlxqZEqJls?t=1m35s\">called </a>to “#SkipTheSpeech” — Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRf1cdw4IAY\">address </a>to both houses, critiquing the nuclear deal with Iran. The video insinuated that Americans were <a href=\"https://youtu.be/tAlxqZEqJls?t=4s\">duped </a>into going to war with Iraq by Netanyahu’s claims that <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saddam_Hussein\">Saddam Hussein</a> was seeking to develop nuclear weapons. </p><p>On September 19-21 2014, at the USCPR’s 13th Annual National Organizers' Conference, Northeastern University student and SJP member <a href=\"https://canarymission.org/individual/Max_Geller\">Max Geller</a> presented a <a href=\"http://blog.endtheoccupation.org/2014/10/exposing-1-state-of-israels-agenda-to.html\">workshop </a>titled: “1% &amp; State of Israel’s Agenda to Silence Criticism of Israel &amp; Promote Anti-Muslim and Anti-Arab Racism.” Geller <a href=\"https://youtu.be/VbZV4VZsnxg?t=30s\">listed </a>major Jewish organizations in the U.S. and <a href=\"https://youtu.be/VbZV4VZsnxg?t=1m15s\">claimed </a>that they were were “vehicles for the 1% to have even more influence over the Israeli-Palestinian conversation in this country,” in order to <a href=\"https://youtu.be/VbZV4VZsnxg?t=2m40s\">protect </a>their financial interests in weapons and oil.</p><p>At the same conference, Professor <a href=\"https://canarymission.org/professor/Rabab_Abdulhadi\">Rabab Abdulhadi</a> served as a panelist and <a href=\"https://youtu.be/9zeSKTmeGPc?t=54s\">accused </a>the <a href=\"http://www.amchainitiative.org/\">AMCHA Initiative</a> of a “smear campaign” against her. Abdulhadi also <a href=\"https://youtu.be/9zeSKTmeGPc?t=2m27s\">claimed </a>that American Jewish organizations, including the <a href=\"http://www.adl.org/about-adl/\">Anti-Defamation League (ADL)</a>, <a href=\"http://www.wiesenthal.com/site/pp.asp?c=lsKWLbPJLnF&amp;b=4441257#.V58ev2i7hBc\">Simon Wiesenthal Center</a> and American Jewish thinkers, like Professor <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Dershowitz\">Alan Dershowitz</a> and late Holocaust survivor <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elie_Wiesel\">Elie Weisel</a> were “engaged in a campaign of repression.”</p><h2>Aiding Campus Divestment Campaigns</h2><p>Per its 2015 Annual Report, then-ETO <a href=\"https://org.salsalabs.com/o/641/images/US%20Campaign%20Annual%20Report%20-%202015%20Small.pdf\">provides </a>(p.16) “one-on-one support... resources, letters, networking, action technology, financial support, and more -- to students leading powerful boycott and divestment campaigns on more than 25 campuses.” <br><br>In the lead up to a divestment resolution in the summer of 2014 ETO <a href=\"https://org.salsalabs.com/o/641/images/US%20Campaign%20Annual%20Report%20-%202015%20Small.pdf\">provided </a>(p.13) “comprehensive, intensive strategic support to member group UCC Palestine Israel Network (PIN) for six months leading up to” a vote by the United Church of Christ (UCC) General Synod to divest from companies doing business in Israel. ETO supported proponents of the resolution by providing “one-on-one consultations, campaign infrastructure, and organized grassroots support to strengthen PIN and the campaign.”</p><p></p><h2>Pressuring Artists</h2>USCPR campaigns to pressure artists to cancel performances in Israel. <p></p><p>On June 29, 2016, USCPR Policy Director Josh Ruebner <a href=\"https://twitter.com/joshruebner/status/748198120140513281\">tweeted </a>a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhon4C4F_fo&amp;feature=youtu.be\">video </a>calling for the musician <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santana_(band)\">Santana</a> to cancel his scheduled performance in Israel. Santana responded in his own <a href=\"http://www.israellycool.com/2016/06/25/carlos-santana-excited-to-come-back-to-tel-aviv/\">video </a>ignoring the pressure and <a href=\"http://www.jpost.com/Israel-News/Santana-and-BDS-460584\">said —  </a>“We look forward to seeing you at Park Hayarkon. Shalom and salam alaykum. Peace.”</p><p>In 2016, USCPR <a href=\"http://www.endtheoccupation.org/article.php?id=4669\">initiated </a>a campaign urging actors and directors nominated for Academy Awards to reject an all-expenses<a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2016/02/11/this-years-oscar-swag-bag-includes-a-55000-trip-to-israel/\"> paid trip</a> to Israel, to see Israel for themselves —  first-hand.<br></p><h2>Targeting Sodastream</h2><p>USCPR <a href=\"https://org.salsalabs.com/o/641/images/US%20Campaign%20Annual%20Report%20-%202015%20Small.pdf\">coordinated </a>(p.10) a divestment campaign to boycott the Israeli company, Sodastream. 500 Palestinians eventually <a href=\"http://www.timesofisrael.com/victory-for-bds-as-sodastreams-last-palestinian-workers-lose-their-jobs/\">lost their jobs</a> when Sodastream moved its factory from the West Bank to southern Israel. Although Sodastream denied that BDS had an impact on its decision to relocate, the BDS movement <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/oct/29/sodastream-move-factory-west-bank-israel-slash-forecast\">took credit</a> for the factory’s closure.</p><h2>Shutting Down Muslim-Jewish Dialogue</h2><p>USCPR <a href=\"https://org.salsalabs.com/o/641/images/US%20Campaign%20Annual%20Report%20-%202015%20Small.pdf\">started</a> (p.13) a petition “to ‘Say No to Faithwashing’” writing an “open letter calling on Muslim Americans to eschew any participation in or legitimization of the Muslim Leadership Initiative of the Shalom Hartman Institute.”</p><p>The Muslim Leadership Initiative (MLI) <a href=\"http://hartman.org.il/Programs_View.asp?Program_Id=110&amp;Cat_Id=517&amp;Cat_Type=Programs\">project</a>, sponsored by the <a href=\"http://hartman.org.il/About_Us_View.asp?Cat_Id=187&amp;Cat_Type=About&amp;Title_Cat_Name=About%20Us\">Shalom Hartman Institute</a> (Hartman’s) —  was <a href=\"http://www.timesofisrael.com/the-partnership-how-a-bold-american-imam-and-his-skeptical-israeli-host-bridged-the-muslim-jewish-chasm/\">founded</a> by Imam Abdullah Antepli, the first Muslim chaplain at Duke University. MLI is an educational program geared to assisting Muslim Americans “understand why Jews believe what they believe, how Jews see their history, why Jews are so attached to this contested strip of land (Israel) — and thus to better engage with American Jews.” According to Antepli, “MLI aims to put mainstream North American Jewry in conversation with their Muslim counterparts.”</p><h2>Demonizing Israel</h2><p>USCPR is a key <a href=\"http://www.endtheoccupation.org/article.php?id=4708\">promoter </a>of <a href=\"http://apartheidweek.org/\">Israeli Apartheid Week (IAW)</a> and organizes programs on college campuses throughout the U.S. claiming to “raise awareness about Israel’s ongoing settler-colonial project and apartheid policies over the Palestinian people” and “mobilize… BDS campaigns.” USCPR offers resources and ideas for how anti-Israel agitators can execute IAW on campus.</p><p>In 2008, to mark the 60th anniversary of the Nakba (“Catastrophe,” in Arabic) USCPR <a href=\"http://www.endtheoccupation.org/section.php?id=224\">produced </a>and distributed propaganda materials about <a href=\"http://mfa.gov.il/MFA/AboutIsrael/History/Pages/Israels%20War%20of%20Independence%20-%201947%20-%201949.aspx\">Israel’s War of Independence</a>. In a “Fact Sheet,” USPCR claimed that a non-binding UN General Assembly resolution (194) — addressing “refugees wishing to return to their homes and live at peace with their neighbours” — made an unqualified, immediate “right of return” a “part of international law.” USPCR also made the counterfeit claim that “Palestinians are specifically guaranteed” that right “by UN Resolution 194.”</p><h2>Defending a Terrorist</h2><p>In 2015, USCPR <a href=\"https://org.salsalabs.com/o/641/images/US%20Campaign%20Annual%20Report%20-%202015%20Small.pdf\">served </a>(p.8) on the Rasmea Odeh Defense Committee in support of   the convicted terrorist. USCPR claimed that Odeh was subject to “government attacks,” “trumped up immigration charges” and a “ U.S. government attempt to stifle Palestine organizing.”</p><p>Odeh was a <a href=\"http://legalinsurrection.com/2014/11/rasmea-odeh-rightly-convicted-of-israeli-supermarket-bombing-and-u-s-immigration-fraud/\">military operative </a>with the <a href=\"http://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-30099510\">Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP)</a>, an <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Popular_Front_For_The_Liberation_Of_Palestine\">internationally designated</a> terrorist organization. In 1969, she masterminded a <a href=\"http://www.jta.org/1969/02/24/archive/jerusalem-supersol-re-opens-for-business-2-young-bombing-victims-are-buried\">bombing</a> that killed two university students in a Jerusalem supermarket. Odeh also attempted to bomb the British consulate.</p><p>Odeh confessed, in a highly detailed <a href=\"https://www.scribd.com/document/288292022/Rasmieh-Odeh-Case-March-1-and-7-1969-Ramieh-Confessions-Exh-I-to-Govt-Response-to-Motion-for-Reconsideration-of-Bond-Revocation\">account</a>, the day following her arrest. In a 2004 documentary, one of Odeh’s co-conspirators <a href=\"https://youtu.be/kfGhHu6VYlE?t=44\">directly implicated</a> her as the mastermind.</p><p>In 1970, an Israeli court tried and convicted Odeh for her involvement in both bombings and sentenced her to life imprisonment. However, Odeh was released 10 years later, in a prisoner swap and emigrated to the United States. <br><br>In November 2014, a Michigan federal jury <a href=\"http://legalinsurrection.com/2014/11/rasmea-odeh-rightly-convicted-of-israeli-supermarket-bombing-and-u-s-immigration-fraud/\">convicted</a> Odeh for immigration fraud —  because she failed to disclose her prior conviction and life sentence, on her immigration application. Odeh was then <a href=\"http://legalinsurrection.com/2015/03/rasmea-odeh-sentenced-to-18-months-in-prison/\">sentenced </a>to 18 months in federal prison, fined and ordered to be deported following her prison term.</p><p>USCPR <a href=\"https://org.salsalabs.com/o/641/images/US%20Campaign%20Annual%20Report%20-%202015%20Small.pdf\">promoted </a>(p.8) the “National Week of Action to Free Rasmea,” after Odeh was found guilty. </p>",

Munayyer made the unsupported allegation that “more than 35 laws in ostensibly democratic Israel discriminate against Palestinians who are Israeli citizens.”</p><p><a href=\"https://canarymission.org/individual/Ramah_Kudaimi\">Ramah Kudaimi</a>, the <a href=\"http://www.endtheoccupation.org/article.php?id=3063\">Director of Grassroots Organizing</a> for USCPR, has <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ramahkudaimi/status/640250322179506180?lang=en\">promoted </a>incitement to <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ramahkudaimi/status/653348890297499648\">violence </a>against Israelis&nbsp;<a href=\"https://twitter.com/ramahkudaimi/status/334759727441534977\">urged </a>platforms to include Holocaust deniers among mainstream voices and, on July 16, 2016, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ramahkudaimi/status/489597598420852737\">called </a>for the destruction of Israel — tweeting: “F**k Israel every day until the fall of the zionist regime.” Kudaimi, who previously worked for CODEPINK and the <a href=\"http://www.aaan.org/?cat=11\">Arab American Action Network (AAAN)</a> — was one of five USCPR delegates <a href=\"http://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/israel-interrogates-deports-u-s-citizens-pro-palestinian-group-n622671\">denied </a>entry into Israel in July 17, 2016, for security reasons, and banned from entering the country for the next 10 years. </p><p>The <a href=\"http://www.endtheoccupation.org/article.php?id=3063\">National Organizer</a> of USCPR <a href=\"https://canarymission.org/individual/Anna_Baltzer\">Anna Baltzer</a> is heavily <a href=\"http://annainpalestine.blogspot.com/2012/08/meet-me-in-st-louis.html\">involved</a> in church divestment campaigns and <a href=\"http://www.annainthemiddleeast.com/presentations/past/livepresentations/index.html\">travels</a> the world promoting these and other BDS causes. Baltzer has <a href=\"http://www.homelandsecurityus.com/archives/7609\">reportedly</a> propagated unsourced claims which she later recanted. In a July 25, 2014 <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=80PY9OK305Q\">interview</a> during <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2014_Israel%E2%80%93Gaza_conflict\">Operation Protective Edge (OPE)</a>, Baltzer denied that Hamas used Palestinian civilians as human shields, despite Hamas <a href=\"http://blogs.channel4.com/factcheck/factcheck-hamas-civilians-human-shields/18534\">openly admitting</a> to the practice several weeks earlier. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXZEzbT0H1s\">(0:18)</a>. Baltzer also referred to Hamas as a “red herring” when asked about how Israel should respond to Hamas provocations (2:00).</p><h2>Attacking Pro-Israel Americans</h2><p>USCPR demonizes pro-Israel Americans by accusing them of improperly influencing U.S. politicians to support their political agenda — USCPR <a href=\"https://org.salsalabs.com/o/641/images/US%20Campaign%20Annual%20Report%20-%202015%20Small.pdf\">wrote </a>(p.8) in its annual 2015 report — “of course the Israel lobby doesn’t limit its advocacy efforts to the federal level. Politicians at the state and even municipal levels are treated to all-expense-paid propaganda trips to Israel, and city and state politicians are pressured to support anti-Palestinian legislation.” </p><p>In March 2015, USCPR <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAlxqZEqJls\">uploaded </a>a short video to Youtube, titled “Bibi’s Bad Advice.” The video <a href=\"https://youtu.be/tAlxqZEqJls?t=1m35s\">called </a>to “#SkipTheSpeech” — Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRf1cdw4IAY\">address </a>to both houses, critiquing the nuclear deal with Iran. The video insinuated that Americans were <a href=\"https://youtu.be/tAlxqZEqJls?t=4s\">duped </a>into going to war with Iraq by Netanyahu’s claims that <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saddam_Hussein\">Saddam Hussein</a> was seeking to develop nuclear weapons. </p><p>On September 19-21 2014, at the USCPR’s 13th Annual National Organizers' Conference, Northeastern University student and SJP member <a href=\"https://canarymission.org/individual/Max_Geller\">Max Geller</a> presented a <a href=\"http://blog.endtheoccupation.org/2014/10/exposing-1-state-of-israels-agenda-to.html\">workshop </a>titled: “1% &amp; State of Israel’s Agenda to Silence Criticism of Israel &amp; Promote Anti-Muslim and Anti-Arab Racism.” Geller <a href=\"https://youtu.be/VbZV4VZsnxg?t=30s\">listed </a>major Jewish organizations in the U.S. and <a href=\"https://youtu.be/VbZV4VZsnxg?t=1m15s\">claimed </a>that they were were “vehicles for the 1% to have even more influence over the Israeli-Palestinian conversation in this country,” in order to <a href=\"https://youtu.be/VbZV4VZsnxg?t=2m40s\">protect </a>their financial interests in weapons and oil.</p><p>At the same conference, Professor <a href=\"https://canarymission.org/professor/Rabab_Abdulhadi\">Rabab Abdulhadi</a> served as a panelist and <a href=\"https://youtu.be/9zeSKTmeGPc?t=54s\">accused </a>the <a href=\"http://www.amchainitiative.org/\">AMCHA Initiative</a> of a “smear campaign” against her. Abdulhadi also <a href=\"https://youtu.be/9zeSKTmeGPc?t=2m27s\">claimed </a>that American Jewish organizations, including the <a href=\"http://www.adl.org/about-adl/\">Anti-Defamation League (ADL)</a>, <a href=\"http://www.wiesenthal.com/site/pp.asp?c=lsKWLbPJLnF&amp;b=4441257#.V58ev2i7hBc\">Simon Wiesenthal Center</a> and American Jewish thinkers, like Professor <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Dershowitz\">Alan Dershowitz</a> and late Holocaust survivor <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elie_Wiesel\">Elie Weisel</a> were “engaged in a campaign of repression.”</p><h2>Aiding Campus Divestment Campaigns</h2><p>Per its 2015 Annual Report, then-ETO <a href=\"https://org.salsalabs.com/o/641/images/US%20Campaign%20Annual%20Report%20-%202015%20Small.pdf\">provides </a>(p.16) “one-on-one support... resources, letters, networking, action technology, financial support, and more -- to students leading powerful boycott and divestment campaigns on more than 25 campuses.” <br><br>In the lead up to a divestment resolution in the summer of 2014 ETO <a href=\"https://org.salsalabs.com/o/641/images/US%20Campaign%20Annual%20Report%20-%202015%20Small.pdf\">provided </a>(p.13) “comprehensive, intensive strategic support to member group UCC Palestine Israel Network (PIN) for six months leading up to” a vote by the United Church of Christ (UCC) General Synod to divest from companies doing business in Israel. ETO supported proponents of the resolution by providing “one-on-one consultations, campaign infrastructure, and organized grassroots support to strengthen PIN and the campaign.”</p><p></p><h2>Pressuring Artists</h2>USCPR campaigns to pressure artists to cancel performances in Israel. <p></p><p>On June 29, 2016, USCPR Policy Director Josh Ruebner <a href=\"https://twitter.com/joshruebner/status/748198120140513281\">tweeted </a>a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhon4C4F_fo&amp;feature=youtu.be\">video </a>calling for the musician <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santana_(band)\">Santana</a> to cancel his scheduled performance in Israel. Santana responded in his own <a href=\"http://www.israellycool.com/2016/06/25/carlos-santana-excited-to-come-back-to-tel-aviv/\">video </a>ignoring the pressure and <a href=\"http://www.jpost.com/Israel-News/Santana-and-BDS-460584\">said —  </a>“We look forward to seeing you at Park Hayarkon. Shalom and salam alaykum. Peace.”</p><p>In 2016, USCPR <a href=\"http://www.endtheoccupation.org/article.php?id=4669\">initiated </a>a campaign urging actors and directors nominated for Academy Awards to reject an all-expenses<a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2016/02/11/this-years-oscar-swag-bag-includes-a-55000-trip-to-israel/\"> paid trip</a> to Israel, to see Israel for themselves —  first-hand.<br></p><h2>Targeting Sodastream</h2><p>USCPR <a href=\"https://org.salsalabs.com/o/641/images/US%20Campaign%20Annual%20Report%20-%202015%20Small.pdf\">coordinated </a>(p.10) a divestment campaign to boycott the Israeli company, Sodastream. 500 Palestinians eventually <a href=\"http://www.timesofisrael.com/victory-for-bds-as-sodastreams-last-palestinian-workers-lose-their-jobs/\">lost their jobs</a> when Sodastream moved its factory from the West Bank to southern Israel. Although Sodastream denied that BDS had an impact on its decision to relocate, the BDS movement <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/oct/29/sodastream-move-factory-west-bank-israel-slash-forecast\">took credit</a> for the factory’s closure.</p><h2>Shutting Down Muslim-Jewish Dialogue</h2><p>USCPR <a href=\"https://org.salsalabs.com/o/641/images/US%20Campaign%20Annual%20Report%20-%202015%20Small.pdf\">started</a> (p.13) a petition “to ‘Say No to Faithwashing’” writing an “open letter calling on Muslim Americans to eschew any participation in or legitimization of the Muslim Leadership Initiative of the Shalom Hartman Institute.”</p><p>The Muslim Leadership Initiative (MLI) <a href=\"http://hartman.org.il/Programs_View.asp?Program_Id=110&amp;Cat_Id=517&amp;Cat_Type=Programs\">project</a>, sponsored by the <a href=\"http://hartman.org.il/About_Us_View.asp?Cat_Id=187&amp;Cat_Type=About&amp;Title_Cat_Name=About%20Us\">Shalom Hartman Institute</a> (Hartman’s) —  was <a href=\"http://www.timesofisrael.com/the-partnership-how-a-bold-american-imam-and-his-skeptical-israeli-host-bridged-the-muslim-jewish-chasm/\">founded</a> by Imam Abdullah Antepli, the first Muslim chaplain at Duke University. MLI is an educational program geared to assisting Muslim Americans “understand why Jews believe what they believe, how Jews see their history, why Jews are so attached to this contested strip of land (Israel) — and thus to better engage with American Jews.” According to Antepli, “MLI aims to put mainstream North American Jewry in conversation with their Muslim counterparts.”</p><h2>Demonizing Israel</h2><p>USCPR is a key <a href=\"http://www.endtheoccupation.org/article.php?id=4708\">promoter </a>of <a href=\"http://apartheidweek.org/\">Israeli Apartheid Week (IAW)</a> and organizes programs on college campuses throughout the U.S. claiming to “raise awareness about Israel’s ongoing settler-colonial project and apartheid policies over the Palestinian people” and “mobilize… BDS campaigns.” USCPR offers resources and ideas for how anti-Israel agitators can execute IAW on campus.</p><p>In 2008, to mark the 60th anniversary of the Nakba (“Catastrophe,” in Arabic) USCPR <a href=\"http://www.endtheoccupation.org/section.php?id=224\">produced </a>and distributed propaganda materials about <a href=\"http://mfa.gov.il/MFA/AboutIsrael/History/Pages/Israels%20War%20of%20Independence%20-%201947%20-%201949.aspx\">Israel’s War of Independence</a>. In a “Fact Sheet,” USPCR claimed that a non-binding UN General Assembly resolution (194) — addressing “refugees wishing to return to their homes and live at peace with their neighbours” — made an unqualified, immediate “right of return” a “part of international law.” USPCR also made the counterfeit claim that “Palestinians are specifically guaranteed” that right “by UN Resolution 194.”</p><h2>Defending a Terrorist</h2><p>In 2015, USCPR <a href=\"https://org.salsalabs.com/o/641/images/US%20Campaign%20Annual%20Report%20-%202015%20Small.pdf\">served </a>(p.8) on the Rasmea Odeh Defense Committee in support of   the convicted terrorist. USCPR claimed that Odeh was subject to “government attacks,” “trumped up immigration charges” and a “ U.S. government attempt to stifle Palestine organizing.”</p><p>Odeh was a <a href=\"http://legalinsurrection.com/2014/11/rasmea-odeh-rightly-convicted-of-israeli-supermarket-bombing-and-u-s-immigration-fraud/\">military operative </a>with the <a href=\"http://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-30099510\">Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP)</a>, an <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Popular_Front_For_The_Liberation_Of_Palestine\">internationally designated</a> terrorist organization. In 1969, she masterminded a <a href=\"http://www.jta.org/1969/02/24/archive/jerusalem-supersol-re-opens-for-business-2-young-bombing-victims-are-buried\">bombing</a> that killed two university students in a Jerusalem supermarket. Odeh also attempted to bomb the British consulate.</p><p>Odeh confessed, in a highly detailed <a href=\"https://www.scribd.com/document/288292022/Rasmieh-Odeh-Case-March-1-and-7-1969-Ramieh-Confessions-Exh-I-to-Govt-Response-to-Motion-for-Reconsideration-of-Bond-Revocation\">account</a>, the day following her arrest. In a 2004 documentary, one of Odeh’s co-conspirators <a href=\"https://youtu.be/kfGhHu6VYlE?t=44\">directly implicated</a> her as the mastermind.</p><p>In 1970, an Israeli court tried and convicted Odeh for her involvement in both bombings and sentenced her to life imprisonment. However, Odeh was released 10 years later, in a prisoner swap and emigrated to the United States. <br><br>In November 2014, a Michigan federal jury <a href=\"http://legalinsurrection.com/2014/11/rasmea-odeh-rightly-convicted-of-israeli-supermarket-bombing-and-u-s-immigration-fraud/\">convicted</a> Odeh for immigration fraud —  because she failed to disclose her prior conviction and life sentence, on her immigration application. Odeh was then <a href=\"http://legalinsurrection.com/2015/03/rasmea-odeh-sentenced-to-18-months-in-prison/\">sentenced </a>to 18 months in federal prison, fined and ordered to be deported following her prison term.</p><p>USCPR <a href=\"https://org.salsalabs.com/o/641/images/US%20Campaign%20Annual%20Report%20-%202015%20Small.pdf\">promoted </a>(p.8) the “National Week of Action to Free Rasmea,” after Odeh was found guilty. </p>",

The charter <a href=\"https://avalon.law.yale.edu/20th_century/hamas.asp\">says</a>: “The Islamic Resistance Movement is one of the links in the chain of the struggle against the Zionist invaders.

The new document has been <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2017/05/02/opinions/hamas-has-not-changed-cristol-opinion/index.html\">described </a>as “a minor change in tactics, not in its ultimate aims.”</p><p>The document was <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-39744551\">reportedly</a> Hamas’s attempt to “connect with the outside world” since it did not contain the same anti-Semitic language of the 1988 charter and did not mention Hamas’s MB origins.

With their money they formed secret societies, such as Freemasons, Rotary Clubs, the Lions and others in different parts of the world for the purpose of sabotaging societies and achieving Zionist interests. With their money they were able to control imperialistic countries and instigate them to colonize many countries in order to enable them to exploit their resources and spread corruption there.”</p></li></ul><ul><li aria-level=\"1\"><p role=\"presentation\">“The Prophet, Allah bless him and grant him salvation, has said: ‘The Day of Judgement will not come about until Moslems fight the Jews (killing the Jews), when the Jew will hide behind stones and trees.

The charter <a href=\"https://avalon.law.yale.edu/20th_century/hamas.asp\">says</a>: “The Islamic Resistance Movement is one of the links in the chain of the struggle against the Zionist invaders.

The invention of these grand illusions of an alleged crime that never occurred, ignoring the millions of dead European victims of Nazism during the war, clearly reveals the racist Zionist face, which believes in the superiority of the Jewish race over the rest of the nations.” </p><p>The 1988 founding charter <a href=\"https://avalon.law.yale.edu/20th_century/hamas.asp\">declares</a>: “The day that enemies usurp part of Moslem land, Jihad becomes the individual duty of every Moslem.

They were behind the French Revolution, the Communist revolution and most of the revolutions we heard and hear about, here and there. With their money they formed secret societies, such as Freemasons, Rotary Clubs, the Lions and others in different parts of the world for the purpose of sabotaging societies and achieving Zionist interests. With their money they were able to control imperialistic countries and instigate them to colonize many countries in order to enable them to exploit their resources and spread corruption there.”</p></li></ul><ul><li aria-level=\"1\"><p role=\"presentation\">“The Prophet, Allah bless him and grant him salvation, has said: ‘The Day of Judgement will not come about until Moslems fight the Jews (killing the Jews), when the Jew will hide behind stones and trees. The stones and trees will say O Moslems, O Abdulla, there is a Jew behind me, come and kill him.

Weiss <a href=\"https://www.theamericanconservative.com/articles/mondoweiss-chapter-one/\">made</a> Mondoweiss an independent website in 2007. </p><p>Articles and social media posts published by Mondoweiss have <a href=\"https://mondoweiss.net/2014/04/palestine-paradise-interview/\">expressed</a> support for terrorists, <a href=\"https://mondoweiss.net/2017/10/contest-celebrate-birthday/\">spread</a> anti-Semitism and <a href=\"https://mondoweiss.net/2018/04/central-zionism-dismantled/\">denied</a> Jewish history and peoplehood.</p><p>Mondoweiss has also <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Mondoweiss/status/1293578012793999361\">spread</a> an anti-Israel conspiracy theory <a href=\"https://mondoweiss.net/2018/12/palestinicides/\">as well as</a> hatred of Israel and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Mondoweiss/status/894599652330414080\">Zionism</a>. </p><p>The site also <a href=\"https://mondoweiss.net/author/palestinian-bds-national-committee/\">provides</a> a platform for <a href=\"https://canarymission.org/organization/Boycott_Divestment_Sanctions\">Boycott, Divestment, Sanctions (BDS)</a> movement leaders and organizations.</p><h2>Background</h2><p>On <a href=\"https://archive.is/Frjd5\">November 8, 2020</a>, the Mondoweiss website <a href=\"https://mondoweiss.net/about-mondoweiss/\">said</a> it was: “[f]ounded in 2006 as a personal blog of journalist Philip Weiss, Mondoweiss grew inside the progressive Jewish community and has become a critical resource for the movement for justice for Palestinians.”</p><p>The site also <a href=\"https://mondoweiss.net/about-mondoweiss/\">claimed</a>: “We recognize that Jewish voices are often prioritized in discussions of Israel and seek to challenge that dynamic by bringing a universalist focus to an issue that is commonly dominated by narrow points of view.” </p><p>On <a href=\"https://archive.is/1pBTz\">May 4, 2015</a>, the Washington Post <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/volokh-conspiracy/wp/2015/05/04/mondoweiss-is-a-hate-site/\">published</a> a column that said: “Anything bad that goes on in Israel will be publicized and exaggerated at Mondoweiss.

    "snippet" : "<h2>Overview</h2><p>The Muslim Brotherhood is a transnational Islamist organization founded in Egypt in 1928. The group today is the largest Muslim movement in the world and is active in <a href=\"http://www.discoverthenetworks.org/Articles/Muslim%20Brotherhood.pdf\" >more than 70 countries</a> (some estimates range<a href=\"http://www.cbn.com/cbnnews/insideisrael/2011/January/What-is-the-Muslim-Brotherhood-/\" > as high as 100+</a>). Islam expert Robert Spencer<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J34Ub8q2niE\" > has called</a> the Brotherhood \"the parent organization of <a href=\"http://www.discoverthenetworks.org/groupProfile.asp?grpid=6204\" >Hamas</a> and <a href=\"http://www.discoverthenetworks.org/groupProfile.asp?grpid=6211\" >al Qaeda</a> (and Islamic Jihad).\"<br></p><h2>Ties to Terrorism</h2>Although in recent years, the organization has claimed to be be a moderate and reformist movement, compelling evidence abounds of the group's undiminished links to terrorism.<p></p><p>The Palestinian chapter of the Brotherhood <a href=\"http://www.discoverthenetworks.org/Articles/Muslim%20Brotherhood.pdf\">created</a> the terrorist organization <a href=\"https://canarymission.org/organization/Hamas\">Hamas</a>. Though previously covert in their alliance, in <a href=\"http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-4159501,00.html\">late 2011</a>, the organization officially accepted Hamas as part of the global Brotherhood movement.</p><p>To emphasize this development, Hamas added the phrase \"a branch of the Muslim Brotherhood – Palestine\" to its official name and Article II of the Hamas <a href=\"http://www.mideastweb.org/hamas.htm\">Charter</a> explicitly <a href=\"http://www.discoverthenetworks.org/Articles/Muslim%20Brotherhood.pdf\">identifies</a>  Hamas as \"one of the wings of Muslim Brotherhood in Palestine.\"<br> <br>The Brotherhood is awash with individuals with explicit links to terrorism and its members publicly encourage jihadist terrorism against the United States and Israel. <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khalid_Sheikh_Mohammed\">Khalid Shaikh Mohammed</a>, the architect of 9/11, was a <a href=\"http://www.biography.com/people/khalid-sheikh-mohammed-241188\">member</a> of the Brotherhood. <a href=\"http://www.discoverthenetworks.org/individualprofile.asp?indid=844\">Abdullah Azzam</a>, a Palestinian <a href=\"http://www.kalamullah.com/Books/defence.pdf\">Brotherhood preacher</a>, was a mentor to al Qaeda kingpin <a href=\"http://www.discoverthenetworks.org/individualprofile.asp?indid=690\">Osama bin Laden</a>. Bin Laden's deputy, <a href=\"http://www.discoverthenetworks.org/individualProfile.asp?indid=843\">Ayman al-Zawahiri</a>, was a Brotherhood member as a young man, though he<a href=\"http://www.discoverthenetworks.org/Articles/Muslim%20Brotherhood.pdf\">later broke with the group</a> because of its willingness to participate in political elections. And bin Laden himself <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/sep/27/osama-bin-laden-blind-eye?newsfeed=true\">belonged</a> to the Saudi branch of the Brotherhood before being ejected in the late 1980s for insisting on waging jihad against the USSR in Afghanistan.<br> <br>Head of the Syrian Muslim Brotherhood <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ali_Sadreddine_Al-Bayanouni\">Ali Sadreddine Bayanouni</a> has repeatedly pledged his support for the terrorism of Hamas and Hezbollah and <a href=\"http://econwarfare.org/americas-muslim-brotherhood-and-mahdi-akef/\">Muhammad Mahdi Othman Ake</a>f, who served as Muslim Brotherhood's Supreme Guide from 2004-2009, openly expressed his support for suicide bombings in Israel and Iraq (during the Iraq War) \"in order to expel the Zionists and the Americans.\"</p><p>Current Brotherhood spiritual leader <a href=\"http://www.discoverthenetworks.org/individualProfile.asp?indid=822\">Yusuf al-Qaradawi</a> has written, \"There is no dialogue between them [the Jews] and us, other than in one language -- the language of the sword and force.\"</p><h2>Religious Fundamentalism</h2>The Muslim Brotherhood <a href=\"http://www.discoverthenetworks.org/Articles/Muslim%20Brotherhood.pdf\">believe </a>that Islam should be “given hegemony over all matters of life.” Toward that end, the Brotherhood seeks to establish an Islamic caliphate, or kingdom -- first spanning all of the present-day Muslim world, and eventually the entire globe. The organization further aspires to dismantle all non-Islamic governments wherever they currently exist, and to make <a href=\"http://www.discoverthenetworks.org/viewSubCategory.asp?id=774\">Islamic Law (Shari’a)</a> the sole basis of jurisprudence everywhere on earth.<br> <br>Their stated and public credo is, like that of <a href=\"https://canarymission.org/organization/Hamas\">Hamas</a>: “God is our objective, the Koran is our Constitution, the Prophet is our leader, struggle [<a href=\"http://www.discoverthenetworks.org/guideDesc.asp?catid=124&amp;type=issue\">jihad</a>] is our way, and death for the sake of God is the highest of our aspirations.”<p></p><p>Since its founding, the Muslim Brotherhood has supported the use of armed struggle, or jihad, against non-Muslim “infidels.” As al-Banna himself wrote: \"Jihad is an obligation from Allah on every Muslim and cannot be ignored nor evaded.\"  Added al-Banna, \"It is the nature of Islam to dominate, not to be dominated, to impose its law on all nations and to extend its power to the entire planet.\"<br></p><h2>Plan for Global Islamic Domination</h2>In 1982, the Muslim Brotherhood adopted a 14-page strategic plan known as \"<a href=\"http://www.centerforsecuritypolicy.org/2014/07/21/hamas-the-tip-of-muslim-brotherhood-spear/\">The Global Project for Palestine</a>,\" which outlined a 12-point strategy to “establish an Islamic government on earth.” This project represented a flexible, multi-phased, long-term plan for a “cultural invasion” of the West. It called for the utilization of multiple tactics including immigration, infiltration, surveillance, propaganda, protest, deception, political legitimacy, and outright terrorism. The Project has served, since its drafting, as the Muslim Brotherhood “master plan.”<p></p><p>At a 1995 conference (hosted by the Muslim Arab Youth Association) in Toledo, Ohio, Muslim Brotherhood spiritual leader <a href=\"http://www.discoverthenetworks.org/individualProfile.asp?indid=822\">Yusuf al-Qaradawi</a> vowed that Islam would \"conquer Europe [and] America -- not through sword but through Da’wa [proselytizing].\" He also urged Muslims to \"continue to fight the Jews\" and \"kill them.\"</p><p>In 1995, Mustafa Mashhur, who would head the Brotherhood in Egypt from 1996-2002, published \"Jihad Is the Way\", the last of a five-volume work titled The Laws of Da’wa. \"Jihad Is the Way\" <a href=\"http://www.jpost.com/MiddleEast/Article.aspx?id=207415\">detailed</a> the Muslim Brotherhood's determination to advance Islam's global conquest, to reestablish an Islamic <a href=\"http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/89739/Caliphate\">Caliphate</a>, and to infuse all Muslims with a sense of duty to wage jihad against Israel. Masshur <a href=\"http://www.jpost.com/MiddleEast/Article.aspx?id=207415\">said</a> that Muslim Brotherhood differed from al Qaeda only in its tactics, not in its goals.</p><p></p><h2>Global Reach</h2>The Muslim Brotherhood today is <a href=\"http://www.discoverthenetworks.org/Articles/Muslim%20Brotherhood.pdf\">global</a> in its reach, wielding influence in almost every country with a Muslim population. Moreover, it <a href=\"http://www.discoverthenetworks.org/Articles/Muslim%20Brotherhood.pdf\">maintains political parties</a> in many Middle-Eastern and African countries, including Algeria, Bahrain, Iraq, Jordan, Somalia, Sudan, Syria, Tunisia, Yemen, and even Israel.<p></p><p>Outside of the Middle East, the Brotherhood exercises a strong influence in Muslim communities throughout Europe. <a href=\"http://www.discoverthenetworks.org/Articles/Muslim%20Brotherhood.pdf\">Among the more prominent</a> Brotherhood organizations in the region are: the Forum of European Muslim Youth and Student Organizations, the Muslim Association of Britain, the European Council for Fatwa and Research, the Islamische Gemeinschaft Deutschland (IGD), and the Union des Organisations Islamiques de France (UOIF).</p><p></p><h2>Funding</h2><!--StartFragment-->The<!--EndFragment-->&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.crethiplethi.com/the-structure-and-funding-sources-of-the-muslim-brotherhood/global-islam/2011/\">extent&nbsp;</a>of the Muslim Brotherhood's economic activity&nbsp;<!--EndFragment-->and funding sources is uncertain and considered one of the movement’s most closely guarded secrets, directly managed by the general guide, his deputies, and the secretary general by virtue of being its major source of power. The movement’s leaders claim that there is no central economic body responsible for funding its activities. In their view, all funds come directly from the pockets of its members, however, most information suggests that the extensive financial network is based on private donors outside of Egypt (mainly from Persian Gulf states and the West), including well-organized foundations; funds collected from the movement’s activists, mainly the wealthy ones; “charity funds” <i>(zakat) </i>collected in mosques and during public conferences organized by the movement (such as Ramadan fastbreaking meals and conferences on the Palestinian issue); and profits from investments made by the movement and its members in various companies and enterprises in Egypt and elsewhere.<p></p><p>The Muslim Brotherhood apparently has extensive connections with Islamic banks and financial institutions, on which it relies to manage its routine financial activities. It is also likely that the movement’s financial system is nourished by regular budgets transferred by the Egyptian regime to legal charitable societies strongly controlled by Muslim Brotherhood members.</p><h2>Background</h2><p>The movement was founded in Egypt in 1928 by <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hassan_al-Banna\" >Hassan al-Banna</a>, an Islamic scholar, schoolteacher and devout admirer of Adolf Hitler and the Nazi regime. The 30's saw the Muslim Brotherhood become an underground organization, which emerged again in the 40's and grew to over 2 million members, post World War 2. In the 1948 War for Israeli Independence, the Brotherhood aided Arabs in Palestine with troops and attacked Jewish citizens of Egypt in retribution.</p><p>In December 1948, a Brotherhood member assassinated Egyptian prime minister Mahmud Fahmi Nuqrashi. Egypt's government retaliated by banishing MB from the country. Then, in February 1949, Hasan al-Banna was killed by government agents in Cairo. A harsh, official crackdown was initiated against the Brotherhood; thousands of its members were imprisoned and many others were confined to detention camps.</p><p>In 1952, the Brotherhood split into two factions. One, led by Hasan al-Hudaybi, favored working with Nasser's secular government in an effort to gradually move the country toward Islamic fundamentalism. A more radical faction, led by the writer and ideologue Sayyid Qutb (1909-1966), advocated armed revolution against corrupt (i.e., non-Islamist) regimes in the Middle East and, more broadly, against unbelievers in Western nations.</p><p>After Muslim Brotherhood member Abdul Munim Abdul Rauf tried to assassinate Egyptian President Nasser in October 1954, the Brotherhood, which had recently received permission to resume its operations in Egypt, was outlawed once again. Nasser dissolved the organization, burned down its headquarters, arrested approximately 15,000 of its members, and executed some others—most famously Qutb. Many of the remaining members fled the country. Muslim Brotherhood receded as a political force in Egypt, where it has been banned ever since.

    "manualBackupText" : "<h2>Overview</h2><p>The Muslim Brotherhood is a transnational Islamist organization founded in Egypt in 1928. The group today is the largest Muslim movement in the world and is active in <a href=\"http://www.discoverthenetworks.org/Articles/Muslim%20Brotherhood.pdf\" >more than 70 countries</a> (some estimates range<a href=\"http://www.cbn.com/cbnnews/insideisrael/2011/January/What-is-the-Muslim-Brotherhood-/\" > as high as 100+</a>). Islam expert Robert Spencer<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J34Ub8q2niE\" > has called</a> the Brotherhood \"the parent organization of <a href=\"http://www.discoverthenetworks.org/groupProfile.asp?grpid=6204\" >Hamas</a> and <a href=\"http://www.discoverthenetworks.org/groupProfile.asp?grpid=6211\" >al Qaeda</a> (and Islamic Jihad).\"<br></p><h2>Ties to Terrorism</h2>Although in recent years, the organization has claimed to be be a moderate and reformist movement, compelling evidence abounds of the group's undiminished links to terrorism.<p></p><p>The Palestinian chapter of the Brotherhood <a href=\"http://www.discoverthenetworks.org/Articles/Muslim%20Brotherhood.pdf\">created</a> the terrorist organization <a href=\"https://canarymission.org/organization/Hamas\">Hamas</a>. Though previously covert in their alliance, in <a href=\"http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-4159501,00.html\">late 2011</a>, the organization officially accepted Hamas as part of the global Brotherhood movement.</p><p>To emphasize this development, Hamas added the phrase \"a branch of the Muslim Brotherhood – Palestine\" to its official name and Article II of the Hamas <a href=\"http://www.mideastweb.org/hamas.htm\">Charter</a> explicitly <a href=\"http://www.discoverthenetworks.org/Articles/Muslim%20Brotherhood.pdf\">identifies</a>  Hamas as \"one of the wings of Muslim Brotherhood in Palestine.\"<br> <br>The Brotherhood is awash with individuals with explicit links to terrorism and its members publicly encourage jihadist terrorism against the United States and Israel. <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khalid_Sheikh_Mohammed\">Khalid Shaikh Mohammed</a>, the architect of 9/11, was a <a href=\"http://www.biography.com/people/khalid-sheikh-mohammed-241188\">member</a> of the Brotherhood. <a href=\"http://www.discoverthenetworks.org/individualprofile.asp?indid=844\">Abdullah Azzam</a>, a Palestinian <a href=\"http://www.kalamullah.com/Books/defence.pdf\">Brotherhood preacher</a>, was a mentor to al Qaeda kingpin <a href=\"http://www.discoverthenetworks.org/individualprofile.asp?indid=690\">Osama bin Laden</a>. Bin Laden's deputy, <a href=\"http://www.discoverthenetworks.org/individualProfile.asp?indid=843\">Ayman al-Zawahiri</a>, was a Brotherhood member as a young man, though he<a href=\"http://www.discoverthenetworks.org/Articles/Muslim%20Brotherhood.pdf\">later broke with the group</a> because of its willingness to participate in political elections. And bin Laden himself <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2012/sep/27/osama-bin-laden-blind-eye?newsfeed=true\">belonged</a> to the Saudi branch of the Brotherhood before being ejected in the late 1980s for insisting on waging jihad against the USSR in Afghanistan.<br> <br>Head of the Syrian Muslim Brotherhood <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ali_Sadreddine_Al-Bayanouni\">Ali Sadreddine Bayanouni</a> has repeatedly pledged his support for the terrorism of Hamas and Hezbollah and <a href=\"http://econwarfare.org/americas-muslim-brotherhood-and-mahdi-akef/\">Muhammad Mahdi Othman Ake</a>f, who served as Muslim Brotherhood's Supreme Guide from 2004-2009, openly expressed his support for suicide bombings in Israel and Iraq (during the Iraq War) \"in order to expel the Zionists and the Americans.\"</p><p>Current Brotherhood spiritual leader <a href=\"http://www.discoverthenetworks.org/individualProfile.asp?indid=822\">Yusuf al-Qaradawi</a> has written, \"There is no dialogue between them [the Jews] and us, other than in one language -- the language of the sword and force.\"</p><h2>Religious Fundamentalism</h2>The Muslim Brotherhood <a href=\"http://www.discoverthenetworks.org/Articles/Muslim%20Brotherhood.pdf\">believe </a>that Islam should be “given hegemony over all matters of life.” Toward that end, the Brotherhood seeks to establish an Islamic caliphate, or kingdom -- first spanning all of the present-day Muslim world, and eventually the entire globe. The organization further aspires to dismantle all non-Islamic governments wherever they currently exist, and to make <a href=\"http://www.discoverthenetworks.org/viewSubCategory.asp?id=774\">Islamic Law (Shari’a)</a> the sole basis of jurisprudence everywhere on earth.<br> <br>Their stated and public credo is, like that of <a href=\"https://canarymission.org/organization/Hamas\">Hamas</a>: “God is our objective, the Koran is our Constitution, the Prophet is our leader, struggle [<a href=\"http://www.discoverthenetworks.org/guideDesc.asp?catid=124&amp;type=issue\">jihad</a>] is our way, and death for the sake of God is the highest of our aspirations.”<p></p><p>Since its founding, the Muslim Brotherhood has supported the use of armed struggle, or jihad, against non-Muslim “infidels.” As al-Banna himself wrote: \"Jihad is an obligation from Allah on every Muslim and cannot be ignored nor evaded.\"  Added al-Banna, \"It is the nature of Islam to dominate, not to be dominated, to impose its law on all nations and to extend its power to the entire planet.\"<br></p><h2>Plan for Global Islamic Domination</h2>In 1982, the Muslim Brotherhood adopted a 14-page strategic plan known as \"<a href=\"http://www.centerforsecuritypolicy.org/2014/07/21/hamas-the-tip-of-muslim-brotherhood-spear/\">The Global Project for Palestine</a>,\" which outlined a 12-point strategy to “establish an Islamic government on earth.” This project represented a flexible, multi-phased, long-term plan for a “cultural invasion” of the West. It called for the utilization of multiple tactics including immigration, infiltration, surveillance, propaganda, protest, deception, political legitimacy, and outright terrorism. The Project has served, since its drafting, as the Muslim Brotherhood “master plan.”<p></p><p>At a 1995 conference (hosted by the Muslim Arab Youth Association) in Toledo, Ohio, Muslim Brotherhood spiritual leader <a href=\"http://www.discoverthenetworks.org/individualProfile.asp?indid=822\">Yusuf al-Qaradawi</a> vowed that Islam would \"conquer Europe [and] America -- not through sword but through Da’wa [proselytizing].\" He also urged Muslims to \"continue to fight the Jews\" and \"kill them.\"</p><p>In 1995, Mustafa Mashhur, who would head the Brotherhood in Egypt from 1996-2002, published \"Jihad Is the Way\", the last of a five-volume work titled The Laws of Da’wa. \"Jihad Is the Way\" <a href=\"http://www.jpost.com/MiddleEast/Article.aspx?id=207415\">detailed</a> the Muslim Brotherhood's determination to advance Islam's global conquest, to reestablish an Islamic <a href=\"http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/89739/Caliphate\">Caliphate</a>, and to infuse all Muslims with a sense of duty to wage jihad against Israel. Masshur <a href=\"http://www.jpost.com/MiddleEast/Article.aspx?id=207415\">said</a> that Muslim Brotherhood differed from al Qaeda only in its tactics, not in its goals.</p><p></p><h2>Global Reach</h2>The Muslim Brotherhood today is <a href=\"http://www.discoverthenetworks.org/Articles/Muslim%20Brotherhood.pdf\">global</a> in its reach, wielding influence in almost every country with a Muslim population. Moreover, it <a href=\"http://www.discoverthenetworks.org/Articles/Muslim%20Brotherhood.pdf\">maintains political parties</a> in many Middle-Eastern and African countries, including Algeria, Bahrain, Iraq, Jordan, Somalia, Sudan, Syria, Tunisia, Yemen, and even Israel.<p></p><p>Outside of the Middle East, the Brotherhood exercises a strong influence in Muslim communities throughout Europe. <a href=\"http://www.discoverthenetworks.org/Articles/Muslim%20Brotherhood.pdf\">Among the more prominent</a> Brotherhood organizations in the region are: the Forum of European Muslim Youth and Student Organizations, the Muslim Association of Britain, the European Council for Fatwa and Research, the Islamische Gemeinschaft Deutschland (IGD), and the Union des Organisations Islamiques de France (UOIF).</p><p></p><h2>Funding</h2><!--StartFragment-->The<!--EndFragment-->&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.crethiplethi.com/the-structure-and-funding-sources-of-the-muslim-brotherhood/global-islam/2011/\">extent&nbsp;</a>of the Muslim Brotherhood's economic activity&nbsp;<!--EndFragment-->and funding sources is uncertain and considered one of the movement’s most closely guarded secrets, directly managed by the general guide, his deputies, and the secretary general by virtue of being its major source of power. The movement’s leaders claim that there is no central economic body responsible for funding its activities. In their view, all funds come directly from the pockets of its members, however, most information suggests that the extensive financial network is based on private donors outside of Egypt (mainly from Persian Gulf states and the West), including well-organized foundations; funds collected from the movement’s activists, mainly the wealthy ones; “charity funds” <i>(zakat) </i>collected in mosques and during public conferences organized by the movement (such as Ramadan fastbreaking meals and conferences on the Palestinian issue); and profits from investments made by the movement and its members in various companies and enterprises in Egypt and elsewhere.<p></p><p>The Muslim Brotherhood apparently has extensive connections with Islamic banks and financial institutions, on which it relies to manage its routine financial activities. It is also likely that the movement’s financial system is nourished by regular budgets transferred by the Egyptian regime to legal charitable societies strongly controlled by Muslim Brotherhood members.</p><h2>Background</h2><p>The movement was founded in Egypt in 1928 by <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hassan_al-Banna\" >Hassan al-Banna</a>, an Islamic scholar, schoolteacher and devout admirer of Adolf Hitler and the Nazi regime. The 30's saw the Muslim Brotherhood become an underground organization, which emerged again in the 40's and grew to over 2 million members, post World War 2. In the 1948 War for Israeli Independence, the Brotherhood aided Arabs in Palestine with troops and attacked Jewish citizens of Egypt in retribution.</p><p>In December 1948, a Brotherhood member assassinated Egyptian prime minister Mahmud Fahmi Nuqrashi. Egypt's government retaliated by banishing MB from the country. Then, in February 1949, Hasan al-Banna was killed by government agents in Cairo. A harsh, official crackdown was initiated against the Brotherhood; thousands of its members were imprisoned and many others were confined to detention camps.</p><p>In 1952, the Brotherhood split into two factions. One, led by Hasan al-Hudaybi, favored working with Nasser's secular government in an effort to gradually move the country toward Islamic fundamentalism. A more radical faction, led by the writer and ideologue Sayyid Qutb (1909-1966), advocated armed revolution against corrupt (i.e., non-Islamist) regimes in the Middle East and, more broadly, against unbelievers in Western nations.</p><p>After Muslim Brotherhood member Abdul Munim Abdul Rauf tried to assassinate Egyptian President Nasser in October 1954, the Brotherhood, which had recently received permission to resume its operations in Egypt, was outlawed once again. Nasser dissolved the organization, burned down its headquarters, arrested approximately 15,000 of its members, and executed some others—most famously Qutb. Many of the remaining members fled the country. Muslim Brotherhood receded as a political force in Egypt, where it has been banned ever since. Notwithstanding the ban, the Egyptian government has permitted the Brotherhood to operate within limits since the 1970s, keeping the organization in check with frequent arrests and crackdowns.</p><p>The <a href=\"http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:lAB9IuUAcHgJ:archive.frontpagemag.com/readArticle.aspx%3FARTID%3D11306+%22sharia%27s+band+of+brothers%22&amp;cd=1&amp;hl=en&amp;ct=clnk&amp;gl=us&amp;source=www.google.com\">first American chapter</a> of the Brotherhood was formed in the early 1960s after hundreds of young Muslims came to the U.S. to study, particularly at large Midwestern universities such as Illinois, Indiana, and Michigan.

October 2015 saw an upsurge in violence across Israel incited by Palestinian political and religious leaders. The wave of stabbings, known as the “Knife Intifada,” saw young Palestinians throughout the country stabbing and attempting to stab scores of Israeli civilians.\n\nThe protesters, including children of senior activists affiliated with the Palestine House, held pictures of terrorists.\n\nDr. Nazih Khatatba, board member and deputy chairman of the Palestine House attended the rally with his grandson. Khatatba held a poster featuring Shadi Doula and his grandson held a poster featuring Mohamad Halabeih.\n\nShadi Hossam al-Deen Doula was an operative of Al-Naser Salah al-Deen Brigades, the military wing of the Palestinian Islamic terrorist organization, the Popular Resistance Committee. In an official statement, Al-Naser Salah al-Deen Brigades said that Shadi Doula was “one of the mujahideen” who was killed on October 12, 2015 “during clashes” with the Israeli military forces.\n\nMohamad Halabeih, an Hamas operative, was killed while trying to attack Israeli officials with an explosive charge.\n\nFadlu Michael, the President of the Palestine House, was seen holding a poster of Anas Hammad.\n\nAnas Hamad, a Hamas operative, was killed while intentionally driving his car into a group of Israeli soldiers in an attempt to kill them. \n\nTwo young girls held posters featuring Sadeq Ziyad Gharbiyya and Husam al-Jabari. \nSadeq Ziyad Gharbiyya, 16, was killed while carrying out a stabbing attack in a checkpoint near Jenin on November 10, 2015. Sadeq Ziyad Gharbiyya posted the Hamas emblem accompanied with the caption: “[We’re] terrorists, but with dignity.” and called Hamas terrorists “heroes” on Facebook.\n\nHusam al-Jabari, 18, and his cousin Bashar al-Jabari,15, tried to enter through a checkpoint armed with a knife. Both were killed while stabbing an Israeli soldier who suspected them.\n\nOn Friday, January 19, 2016, Palestine House celebrated the 14th birthday of the Palestinian child terrorist Ahmed Manasrah and called for his immediate release from the Israeli jail. A birthday cake was baked in honour of Ahmad Manasrah and decorated with the following message written on it: “Happy Birthday. Freedom. Ahmad Manasrah, 13 years old boy, shot and caged by Israel.”\n\nAhmed Manasra (sometimes spelled Mansara) was wounded on October 12, 2015, while he and his 15 year-old cousin, Hassan, were engaged in a stabbing spree in Jerusalem, critically wounding a 13 year-old Israeli boy and moderately wounding a 25 year-old man. \nThe Manasras’ stabbing spree was interrupted when police shot Hassan and a passing Israeli motorist hit Ahmed, who was thereupon surrounded by enraged and cursing onlookers.  \nManasra, who admitted to investigators “I went there to stab Jews,” was later tried and convicted on two counts of attempted murder.",

The group originally started as the New York City chapter of <a href=\"https://canarymission.org/organization/Students_For_Justice_In_Palestine\">Students for Justice in Palestine (SJP)</a>. In February 2018, Kiswani, then <a href=\"http://pacechronicle.com/feature/2016/04/07/students-for-justice-in-palestine-discuss-one-state-solution/\">chair</a> of NYC SJP, <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/WOL.Palestine/photos/a.1028890630457565/2351286268217988/?type=3\">rebranded</a> and expanded the group beyond its student-based constituency, re-launching it as WOL.<br></p><p>The group’s official page <a href=\"https://archive.ph/0IQNi\">states</a>: “Within Our Lifetime is not only a name, but a promise, a motivational cry, a rally, and a call to action.”</p><p>In May 2018, following the rebranding, WOL <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/events/370286486787263/\">held</a> its “1st Annual Palestine Lives Conference,” featuring a host of anti-Israel agitators as “special guest speakers.” The official conference poster <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/Pal.Youth.Movement/photos/gm.379261019223143/2165291226832333/?type=3&amp;theater\">featured </a>a photo of armed men in <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinian_keffiyeh\">keffiyehs</a>, with the caption: “Resisting Settler Colonialism Since 1948.” </p><p>The group <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/events/the-peoples-forum/2nd-annual-palestine-lives-conference/1754702457962727/\">held</a> its 2nd conference in 2019, followed by a two-year hiatus due to the COVID pandemic, and <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/WOL.Palestine/photos/a.2113300728683211/5051027921577129/?type=3&amp;eid=ARC0vEB0fTO9UzBPRqrG2R2Ajo3JEYqmu4qQUQ8MbboUVfE12MIGr66DrxR-mwCzFsV28ApMJgzH97KB\">resumed</a> the annual event in 2022.</p><p>WOL <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/WOL.Palestine/posts/5449060175107233/\">organizes</a> annual “Nakba Day” rallies in May and <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/CZ5Fh6BJee_/\">stages</a> [00:11:22] serial anti-Israel protests from May through September, coinciding with summer recess in most of the city’s schools and colleges.</p><p>Nakba is generally translated as “catastrophe” in Arabic, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nakba_Day\" >referring </a>to the outcome of the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1948_Arab%E2%80%93Israeli_War\" >1948 Arab-Israeli War</a>. It is a term often used to delegitimize the creation of the State of Israel by defining it as a catastrophe.<br></p><h2>Ideology and Tactics</h2><p>WOL expands SJP’s reach by <a href=\"https://archive.ph/2hsGF\">providing</a> a platform and tools for post-graduate anti-Israel activists to other “theaters of operation” outside of campuses. WOL activists have <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/CT-c-JgJYJJ/\">organized</a> actions on city streets and highways, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbO_MhzzKZg&amp;t=182s\">as well as</a> in parks, train stations and subway cars.</p><p>WOL regularly <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/CZ5Fh6BJee_/\">idolizes</a> [00:34:06] convicted terrorists like <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leila_Khaled\">Leila Khaled</a> and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rasmea_Odeh\">Rasmea Odeh</a> at rallies <a href=\"https://archive.ph/Ds6hB\">and</a> online events.</p><p>WOL’s ideological platform is based on four <a href=\"https://archive.ph/wip/oJ30e\">main tenets</a>, or “Points of Unity,” and is outlined below.</p><p><b>1. Right of Return</b></p><p>“We uphold the right of all Palestinian refugees to return to their homeland in all of historic Palestine from the Jordan River to the Mediterranean Sea.”</p><p>The “right of return” is a Palestinian demand <a href=\"https://youtu.be/iggdO7C70P8?t=16\">discredited</a> as a means to eliminate Israel. International law <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_of_return#cite_ref-3\">mandates</a> no absolute right of return and <a href=\"https://www.unrwa.org/content/resolution-194\">UN Resolution 194</a>, which defined principles for “refugees wishing to return to their homes,” was unanimously rejected by Arab nations following the 1948 Arab-Israeli War<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1948_Arab%E2%80%93Israeli_War\">.</a></p><p><b>2. Anti-Zionism</b></p><p>“We are anti-zionists. Zionism is a settler-colonial white supremacist ideology built on the genocide and dispossession of the Palestinian people. We therefore reject all collaboration and dialogue with zionist organizations through a strict policy of anti-normalization. The liberation of Palestine requires the abolition of zionism.”</p><p><a href=\"http://www.zionism-israel.com/zionism_definitions.htm\">Zionism </a>is the belief that Jews have the right to self-determination in their own national home, and the right to develop their national culture.</p><p>Proponents of the “<a href=\"https://nationalpost.com/opinion/the-anti-israel-movements-anti-normalization-campaign\">anti-normalization</a>” policy seek to<a href=\"http://www.haaretz.com/jewish/the-jewish-thinker/.premium-1.664018\"> police</a> all interactions between Israelis and Palestinians and shut down all conversations and interactions perceived as being ideologically unaligned with their own agenda. They feel “liberal Zionist” dialogue with Palestinians “normalizes” entrenched power dynamics. This policy was originally dictated by the <a href=\"https://bdsmovement.net/bnc\">BDS National Committee (BNC)</a>, which prioritized the “Monitoring &amp; Rapid Response” against interactions that recognize or cooperate with “Israel’s regime.”</p><p><b>3. Right to Resist</b></p><p>“We defend the right of Palestinians as colonized people to resist the zionist occupation by any means necessary… we uphold the right of all oppressed nationality people in the United States and around the world to engage in all forms of struggle in pursuit of freedom.”</p><p><b>4. Internationalism</b></p><p>“We have a responsibility as those living within the United States to resist the violence of the U.S. empire at home and abroad.” </p><h2>Founders</h2><p><b>Nerdeen Kiswani</b></p><p><a href=\"https://canarymission.org/individual/Nerdeen_Kiswani\">Nerdeen Kiswani</a> has <a href=\"https://youtu.be/tbO_MhzzKZg?t=3763\">called </a>for the death of Zionists and for Israel’s <a href=\"https://youtu.be/yK1o1WV5EuQ?t=545\">destruction</a>.

However, the group is not found to be registered in any U.S. state as a nonprofit organization under its official name. Nor is there any listing for WOL under its name on the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) <a href=\"https://apps.irs.gov/app/eos/\">website</a> for tax-exempt organizations.</p><p>The group also makes no information available to the public on its website or official social media pages regarding its legal and/or tax status.</p><h2>Key Findings</h2><p><b>Organizing Anti-Israel Rallies</b></p><p>WOL <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/CQ6wFErHZV7/\">organizes</a> large-scale anti-Israel rallies <a href=\"https://archive.ph/wip/PJr1Y\">and</a> protests in New York City on a regular basis, often in partnership with other anti-Israel groups and intersectional allies, such as <a href=\"https://decolonizethisplace.org/\">Decolonize This Place (DTP)</a>, which <a href=\"https://decolonizethisplace.org/faxxx-1\">demands</a> the “abolition of prisons and police, bosses and borders.” <br><br>WOL activists frequently <a href=\"https://archive.ph/VU0F6\">stage</a> the <a href=\"https://youtu.be/qPj5LvjVoHw?t=20\">burning</a> [00:00:20] of Israeli flags as the <a href=\"https://youtu.be/1NHhOh_xF90?t=36\">centerpiece</a> [00:00:36] of their rallies.</p><p>WOL leaders have <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/CZ5Fh6BJee_/\">claimed</a> [00:20:28] 50,000 participants at some of their best-attended events. On numerous occasions, WOL protests have turned <a href=\"https://archive.ph/4WX5g\">violent</a> and ended in the arrests of its participants. Below is a sample of the violence that occurred at WOL rallies. </p><p>On <a href=\"https://archive.ph/wip/4WX5g\">April 20, 2022</a>, WOL leader<a href=\"https://canarymission.org/individual/Saadah_Masoud\"> Saadah Masoud</a> violently <a href=\"https://www.jns.org/anti-israel-protester-assaults-new-york-man-at-palestinian-resistance-rally/\">assaulted</a> Matt Greenman, an Israel supporter, during a WOL rally in midtown Manhattan. Masoud <a href=\"https://archive.ph/wip/6qPXW\">reportedly</a> verbally threatened Greenman, followed him, chased him down, threw him to the ground and punched and kicked him in the face. After the assault, Masoud <a href=\"https://youtu.be/6Qn3XvdPMjI?t=2874\">stole</a> Greenman’s Israeli flag and gave it to another activist who later trampled and burned it. </p><p>Following the incident, Greenman <a href=\"https://www.jpost.com/bds-threat/article-705134\">reportedly </a>went to the emergency room where he was diagnosed with a concussion, in addition to other injuries. Greenman <a href=\"https://www.jpost.com/bds-threat/article-705134\">said</a> he filed a police report and an investigation was opened following the incident. </p><p>In <a href=\"https://archive.ph/cOwXi\">November 2022</a>, Masoud <a href=\"https://archive.ph/IbJa2\">pled</a> guilty to a federal hate crimes conspiracy charge for attacking Greenman. The same indictment accused Masoud of two additional anti-Semitic assaults which had taken place in 2021. In a press release issued by the U.S. Justice Department, U.S. Attorney Damian Williams said: “Saadah Masoud deliberately targeted three victims because of their religion and nation of origin.”</p><p><!--StartFragment-->In <a href=\"https://archive.ph/zxTWD\">March 2023</a>, Masoud received an 18-month prison <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/usao-sdny/pr/staten-island-man-sentenced-18-months-prison-conspiracy-commit-antisemitic-hate-crimes\">sentence</a> after <a href=\"https://archive.ph/IbJa2\">pleading</a> guilty to participating in a conspiracy to commit violent hate <a href=\"https://archive.ph/cOwXi\">crimes</a> against Jews in April 2022, June 2021 and May 2021.

The group originally started as the New York City chapter of <a href=\"https://canarymission.org/organization/Students_For_Justice_In_Palestine\">Students for Justice in Palestine (SJP)</a>. In February 2018, Kiswani, then <a href=\"http://pacechronicle.com/feature/2016/04/07/students-for-justice-in-palestine-discuss-one-state-solution/\">chair</a> of NYC SJP, <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/WOL.Palestine/photos/a.1028890630457565/2351286268217988/?type=3\">rebranded</a> and expanded the group beyond its student-based constituency, re-launching it as WOL.<br></p><p>The group’s official page <a href=\"https://archive.ph/0IQNi\">states</a>: “Within Our Lifetime is not only a name, but a promise, a motivational cry, a rally, and a call to action.”</p><p>In May 2018, following the rebranding, WOL <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/events/370286486787263/\">held</a> its “1st Annual Palestine Lives Conference,” featuring a host of anti-Israel agitators as “special guest speakers.” The official conference poster <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/Pal.Youth.Movement/photos/gm.379261019223143/2165291226832333/?type=3&amp;theater\">featured </a>a photo of armed men in <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinian_keffiyeh\">keffiyehs</a>, with the caption: “Resisting Settler Colonialism Since 1948.” </p><p>The group <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/events/the-peoples-forum/2nd-annual-palestine-lives-conference/1754702457962727/\">held</a> its 2nd conference in 2019, followed by a two-year hiatus due to the COVID pandemic, and <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/WOL.Palestine/photos/a.2113300728683211/5051027921577129/?type=3&amp;eid=ARC0vEB0fTO9UzBPRqrG2R2Ajo3JEYqmu4qQUQ8MbboUVfE12MIGr66DrxR-mwCzFsV28ApMJgzH97KB\">resumed</a> the annual event in 2022.</p><p>WOL <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/WOL.Palestine/posts/5449060175107233/\">organizes</a> annual “Nakba Day” rallies in May and <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/CZ5Fh6BJee_/\">stages</a> [00:11:22] serial anti-Israel protests from May through September, coinciding with summer recess in most of the city’s schools and colleges.</p><p>Nakba is generally translated as “catastrophe” in Arabic, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nakba_Day\" >referring </a>to the outcome of the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1948_Arab%E2%80%93Israeli_War\" >1948 Arab-Israeli War</a>. It is a term often used to delegitimize the creation of the State of Israel by defining it as a catastrophe.<br></p><h2>Ideology and Tactics</h2><p>WOL expands SJP’s reach by <a href=\"https://archive.ph/2hsGF\">providing</a> a platform and tools for post-graduate anti-Israel activists to other “theaters of operation” outside of campuses. WOL activists have <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/CT-c-JgJYJJ/\">organized</a> actions on city streets and highways, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tbO_MhzzKZg&amp;t=182s\">as well as</a> in parks, train stations and subway cars.</p><p>WOL regularly <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/CZ5Fh6BJee_/\">idolizes</a> [00:34:06] convicted terrorists like <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leila_Khaled\">Leila Khaled</a> and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rasmea_Odeh\">Rasmea Odeh</a> at rallies <a href=\"https://archive.ph/Ds6hB\">and</a> online events.</p><p>WOL’s ideological platform is based on four <a href=\"https://archive.ph/wip/oJ30e\">main tenets</a>, or “Points of Unity,” and is outlined below.</p><p><b>1. Right of Return</b></p><p>“We uphold the right of all Palestinian refugees to return to their homeland in all of historic Palestine from the Jordan River to the Mediterranean Sea.”</p><p>The “right of return” is a Palestinian demand <a href=\"https://youtu.be/iggdO7C70P8?t=16\">discredited</a> as a means to eliminate Israel. International law <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_of_return#cite_ref-3\">mandates</a> no absolute right of return and <a href=\"https://www.unrwa.org/content/resolution-194\">UN Resolution 194</a>, which defined principles for “refugees wishing to return to their homes,” was unanimously rejected by Arab nations following the 1948 Arab-Israeli War<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1948_Arab%E2%80%93Israeli_War\">.</a></p><p><b>2. Anti-Zionism</b></p><p>“We are anti-zionists. Zionism is a settler-colonial white supremacist ideology built on the genocide and dispossession of the Palestinian people. We therefore reject all collaboration and dialogue with zionist organizations through a strict policy of anti-normalization. The liberation of Palestine requires the abolition of zionism.”</p><p><a href=\"http://www.zionism-israel.com/zionism_definitions.htm\">Zionism </a>is the belief that Jews have the right to self-determination in their own national home, and the right to develop their national culture.</p><p>Proponents of the “<a href=\"https://nationalpost.com/opinion/the-anti-israel-movements-anti-normalization-campaign\">anti-normalization</a>” policy seek to<a href=\"http://www.haaretz.com/jewish/the-jewish-thinker/.premium-1.664018\"> police</a> all interactions between Israelis and Palestinians and shut down all conversations and interactions perceived as being ideologically unaligned with their own agenda. They feel “liberal Zionist” dialogue with Palestinians “normalizes” entrenched power dynamics. This policy was originally dictated by the <a href=\"https://bdsmovement.net/bnc\">BDS National Committee (BNC)</a>, which prioritized the “Monitoring &amp; Rapid Response” against interactions that recognize or cooperate with “Israel’s regime.”</p><p><b>3. Right to Resist</b></p><p>“We defend the right of Palestinians as colonized people to resist the zionist occupation by any means necessary… we uphold the right of all oppressed nationality people in the United States and around the world to engage in all forms of struggle in pursuit of freedom.”</p><p><b>4. Internationalism</b></p><p>“We have a responsibility as those living within the United States to resist the violence of the U.S. empire at home and abroad.” </p><h2>Founders</h2><p><b>Nerdeen Kiswani</b></p><p><a href=\"https://canarymission.org/individual/Nerdeen_Kiswani\">Nerdeen Kiswani</a> has <a href=\"https://youtu.be/tbO_MhzzKZg?t=3763\">called </a>for the death of Zionists and for Israel’s <a href=\"https://youtu.be/yK1o1WV5EuQ?t=545\">destruction</a>.

However, the group is not found to be registered in any U.S. state as a nonprofit organization under its official name. Nor is there any listing for WOL under its name on the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) <a href=\"https://apps.irs.gov/app/eos/\">website</a> for tax-exempt organizations.</p><p>The group also makes no information available to the public on its website or official social media pages regarding its legal and/or tax status.</p><h2>Key Findings</h2><p><b>Organizing Anti-Israel Rallies</b></p><p>WOL <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/CQ6wFErHZV7/\">organizes</a> large-scale anti-Israel rallies <a href=\"https://archive.ph/wip/PJr1Y\">and</a> protests in New York City on a regular basis, often in partnership with other anti-Israel groups and intersectional allies, such as <a href=\"https://decolonizethisplace.org/\">Decolonize This Place (DTP)</a>, which <a href=\"https://decolonizethisplace.org/faxxx-1\">demands</a> the “abolition of prisons and police, bosses and borders.” <br><br>WOL activists frequently <a href=\"https://archive.ph/VU0F6\">stage</a> the <a href=\"https://youtu.be/qPj5LvjVoHw?t=20\">burning</a> [00:00:20] of Israeli flags as the <a href=\"https://youtu.be/1NHhOh_xF90?t=36\">centerpiece</a> [00:00:36] of their rallies.</p><p>WOL leaders have <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/CZ5Fh6BJee_/\">claimed</a> [00:20:28] 50,000 participants at some of their best-attended events. On numerous occasions, WOL protests have turned <a href=\"https://archive.ph/4WX5g\">violent</a> and ended in the arrests of its participants. Below is a sample of the violence that occurred at WOL rallies. </p><p>On <a href=\"https://archive.ph/wip/4WX5g\">April 20, 2022</a>, WOL leader<a href=\"https://canarymission.org/individual/Saadah_Masoud\"> Saadah Masoud</a> violently <a href=\"https://www.jns.org/anti-israel-protester-assaults-new-york-man-at-palestinian-resistance-rally/\">assaulted</a> Matt Greenman, an Israel supporter, during a WOL rally in midtown Manhattan. Masoud <a href=\"https://archive.ph/wip/6qPXW\">reportedly</a> verbally threatened Greenman, followed him, chased him down, threw him to the ground and punched and kicked him in the face. After the assault, Masoud <a href=\"https://youtu.be/6Qn3XvdPMjI?t=2874\">stole</a> Greenman’s Israeli flag and gave it to another activist who later trampled and burned it. </p><p>Following the incident, Greenman <a href=\"https://www.jpost.com/bds-threat/article-705134\">reportedly </a>went to the emergency room where he was diagnosed with a concussion, in addition to other injuries.

    "snippet" : "<h2>Overview</h2><p>IfNotNow (INN) is an anti-Israel organization <a href=\"https://ifnotnowmovement.org/about-us/\">founded </a>in 2014 in response to <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2014_Israel%E2%80%93Gaza_conflict\">Operation Protective Edge (OPE)</a>. The group claims to be “young Jews angered by the overwhelmingly hawkish response of American Jewish institutions” to the operation.</p><p>The group launched their official website in 2016 and <a href=\"https://www.haaretz.com/jewish/.premium-protest-not-dialogue-to-end-the-occupation-1.5377976\">claims </a>to have established chapters across the United States. They <a href=\"https://ifnotnowmovement.org/about-us/\">present</a> three demands on their website: “Stop the War on Gaza, End the Occupation, and Freedom and Dignity for All.” </p><p>INN <a href=\"https://www.timesofisrael.com/rallying-against-trump-and-jewish-organizations-ifnotnow-brings-young-leftist-jews-to-the-streets/\">describes</a>&nbsp;itself as an organization “steeped both in left-wing protest and Jewish tradition” that <a href=\"https://ifnotnowmovement.org/about-us/our-principles/\">seeks</a> to “end American Jewish support for the occupation.” </p><p>INN’s name is <a href=\"https://ifnotnowmovement.org/about-us/our-story/\">derived</a> from the end of a quote by the Jewish sage Hillel the Elder: “If I am not for myself, who will be for me? But if I am only for myself, who am I? If not now, when?\" The group asserts that they take this saying as instruction “to reinterpret the tradition so that we too may continue the struggle for Jewish liberation in our age,” which they claim to be connected to “Palestinian liberation.”</p><p>INN <a href=\"https://www.timesofisrael.com/rallying-against-trump-and-jewish-organizations-ifnotnow-brings-young-leftist-jews-to-the-streets/\">claims</a> to take no position on a two-state solution or the <a href=\"https://canarymission.org/organization/Boycott_Divestment_Sanctions\">Boycott, Divestment, Sanctions (BDS)</a> movement. The group mainly <a href=\"http://mondoweiss.net/2017/04/ifnotnow-promising-problems/\">opposes </a>what it calls the American Jewish establishment’s support for the “occupation” and has been careful not to weigh in on other issues, which allows it to attract anti-Zionist activists from <a href=\"http://jstreet.org/j-street-u/\">JStreet U</a> and from <a href=\"https://canarymission.org/organization/Jewish_Voice_For_Peace\">Jewish Voice for Peace (JVP)</a>.</p><h2>Structure, Allies and Agenda</h2><p>INN <a href=\"https://www.haaretz.com/jewish/.premium-protest-not-dialogue-to-end-the-occupation-1.5377976\">asserts</a> that they are a decentralized movement with no organizational hierarchy, calling each of its organizers “leaders.” Many of the group’s founders were <a href=\"http://mondoweiss.net/2014/09/collapse-israel-consensus/\">former members</a> of <a href=\"http://jstreet.org/j-street-u/\">JStreet U</a>.</p><p>One of the group’s founders is Simone Zimmerman. Zimmerman was<a href=\"https://www.haaretz.com/world-news/sanders-suspends-new-jewish-outreach-coordinator-1.5433112\"> fired </a>from her position as the “Jewish outreach coordinator” for the Bernie Sanders’s presidential campaign, for posting on Facebook that “Bibi Netanyahu is an arrogant, deceptive, cynical, manipulative a**hole.”</p><p>In describing the motivation behind the group’s founding, Zimmerman <a href=\"https://www.haaretz.com/opinion/u-s-jewish-millennials-aren-t-disengaged-from-israel-we-re-angry-1.5411085\">explained</a>, “The problem is nearly 50 years of occupation.” </p><p>In some cities, members and leaders of the anti-Israel JVP organization are also <a href=\"https://www.haaretz.com/jewish/.premium-protest-not-dialogue-to-end-the-occupation-1.5377976\">deeply involved</a> with INN. Many INN activists participate in JVP actions and vice versa. JVP spokeswoman<a href=\"https://canarymission.org/individual/Naomi_Dann\"> Naomi Dann</a> reportedly <a href=\"https://wagingnonviolence.org/feature/if-not-now-israel-palestine-occupation/\">consults </a>regularly<a href=\"https://wagingnonviolence.org/feature/if-not-now-israel-palestine-occupation/\"> </a>with members of INN. </p><p>INN initially <a href=\"http://mondoweiss.net/2014/09/collapse-israel-consensus/\">spurned</a> collaboration with JVP. However, in June 2017, INN <a href=\"http://www.jvpphilly.org/media/2017/3/2/ifnotnow-and-jewish-voice-for-peace-philadelphia-joint-statement-on-anti-semitism\">joined</a> JVP in protesting Israel at the Salute to Israel parade in New York City.</p><p>INN have also allied themselves with the anti-Israel <a href=\"https://canarymission.org/organization/American_Muslims_For_Palestine\">American Muslims for Palestine (AMP)</a>. SJP and AMP founder, professor <a href=\"https://canarymission.org/professor/Hatem_Bazian\">Hatem Bazian</a>, openly <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/HatemBazian/videos/10157523803173378/?t=464\">praised </a>the coalition between INN and AMP.

Other anti-Israel entities that have <a href=\"https://fmep.org/grant-program/our-grantees/\">received </a>funding from FMEP include JVP, <a href=\"http://www.breakingthesilence.org.il/\">Breaking The Silence</a> and <a href=\"https://palestinelegal.org/\">Palestine Legal</a>.</p><p>On March 9, 2017, INN was<a href=\"https://www.rbf.org/grantees/grantee-grant-17-70\"> awarded</a> a $20,000 grant from the <a href=\"https://www.rbf.org/\">Rockefeller Brothers Fund (RBF)</a>. RBF has a history of <a href=\"http://www.tabletmag.com/jewish-news-and-politics/235453/rockefeller-brothers-fund-gets-behind-bds\">supporting</a> anti-Jewish causes, including BDS campaigns and various organizations that promote BDS throughout the United States.  </p><p>INN has an Indiegogo <a href=\"https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/ifnotnow-training-new-jewish-leaders-for-justice#/\">crowdfunding page</a> set up to raise funds for their various training sessions. The group has also set up various legal defense<a href=\"https://fundrazr.com/ifnotnowlegaldefense?ref=ab_9jc3iZ9q6FR9jc3iZ9q6FR\"> pages</a> to help pay legal fees for their members’ <a href=\"https://www.haaretz.com/us-news/.premium-7-jewish-activists-arrested-at-schumer-s-ny-office-in-gaza-protest-1.5988619\">numerous arrests</a>, stemming from their <a href=\"https://www.bostonglobe.com/metro/2018/04/03/protesters-chained-themselves-door-israeli-consulate-boston/per72r8y6orivO8JbGJWyK/story.html\">disruptive actions.</a></p><p>INN also regularly disseminates <a href=\"https://medium.com/@IfNotNow/37-young-american-jews-arrested-nationwide-over-two-weeks-5526afa57037\">articles</a> from their Medium.com account, which they use to display their accomplishments and solicit donations.</p><h2>Tactics </h2><p>INN has a particular <a href=\"https://www.timesofisrael.com/rallying-against-trump-and-jewish-organizations-ifnotnow-brings-young-leftist-jews-to-the-streets/\">focus </a>on disruptive protests of pro-Israel events and institutions. To this end, INN have <a href=\"https://www.haaretz.com/jewish/.premium-protest-not-dialogue-to-end-the-occupation-1.5377976\">held</a> multiple sit-in protests in the lobbies of buildings housing mainstream Jewish organizations. </p><p>On April 20, 2016, two days before the Jewish Passover holiday, approximately 100 INN members <a href=\"https://www.haaretz.com/jewish/.premium-protest-not-dialogue-to-end-the-occupation-1.5377976\">entered </a>the Manhattan headquarters of the Anti-Defamation League (ADL). Seventeen activists refused to leave when instructed by police and were arrested for trespassing and disorderly conduct. </p><p>Following the incident, ADL Director Jonathan Greenblatt issued a <a href=\"https://www.adl.org/news/press-releases/adl-statement-on-if-not-now-protest-at-its-national-headquarters\">statement</a> that said: “INN never attempted to contact us about their intended visit or to engage us in any meaningful dialogue. In fact, ADL immediately extended an invitation to meet, which INN rejected.”</p><p>On April 19, 2016, INN members <a href=\"https://www.haaretz.com/jewish/.premium-protest-not-dialogue-to-end-the-occupation-1.5377976\">protested</a> outside the building housing the Boston Jewish Community Relations Council (JCRC) and Jewish federation. JCRC Executive Director Jeremy Burton publicly invited INN members to have an open meeting to discuss their objectives; INN refused the invitation. </p><p>On March 26, 2017, INN members <a href=\"https://www.jpost.com/Diaspora/Jewish-group-calls-to-reject-occupation-in-protest-at-AIPAC-conference-485307\">organized </a>a protest outside the Washington D.C. venue of the American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC) Conference. Several hundred protesters spent hours <a href=\"https://youtu.be/SHgIXGaFaLU\">dancing</a> and chanting outside, while some <a href=\"https://www.haaretz.com/us-news/hundreds-march-outside-aipac-in-protest-of-israeli-settlements-1.5453568\">chained</a> themselves to the entrance of the conference center. </p><p>Four INN activists <a href=\"https://forward.com/fast-forward/367120/watch-ifnotnow-protesters-break-into-aipac/\">purchased</a> tickets to the conference as AIPAC delegates, in order to gain access to the building. Once inside, the INN activists dropped banners from the center’s third floor, stating that they “reject AIPAC and the occupation,” before being removed by security.</p><p>On April 19, 2018, INN <a href=\"https://thejewishnews.com/2018/05/03/standing-with-israel-ifnotnow-detroit/\">protested</a> outside Metro Detroit’s Hillel Day School’s annual Israel Independence Day celebration. A group of approximately 15 activists, representing INN Detroit came onto the school’s sidewalk, unfurled a banner and began singing. They distributed flyers to attendees that said, “we can no longer be silent as our community supports pro-Israel-at-any-costs politics.” </p><h2>Initiatives</h2><p>INN seeks to <a href=\"https://ifnotnowmovement.org/about-us/our-strategy/\">advance</a> their agenda through what they call “public action and imaginative ritual.” Their programming includes the following initiatives.</p><p><i><b>Liberation Seders</b></i></p><p>In April 2016, prior to the Passover holiday, INN leaders <a href=\"https://forward.com/author/ethan-miller-and-sara-sandmel/\">Ethan Miller and Sara Sandmel</a> <a href=\"https://forward.com/opinion/338979/this-passover-were-joining-simone-zimmerman-to-fight-for-freedom-for-all/\">wrote </a>an op-ed casting Palestinians in the roles of ancient Hebrews liberated from Egypt. The op-ed stated that INN actions would take place in Washington DC, Boston, New York City, Chicago and the San Francisco Bay Area.</p><p>Two days before Passover, approximately 100 INN members entered the New York City building housing the ADL. Seventeen <a href=\"https://www.haaretz.com/jewish/.premium-protest-not-dialogue-to-end-the-occupation-1.5377976\">refused</a> to leave when police instructed them to and were arrested for trespassing and disorderly conduct. Another 100 members held a liberation seder in front of Hillel International’s office in Washington DC. </p><p>In Boston, INN activists held a liberation seder in front of the local Jewish Federation before moving to the Boston AIPAC office and chaining themselves outside. Six who chained themselves inside the lobby were arrested.</p><p>In Berkeley, INN members set up inside the local Jewish Federation office. After police forced out into the street by police, they continued to chant anti-Israel slogans.</p><p>Many of the activists set up tables and <a href=\"https://972mag.com/23-young-jews-arrested-in-anti-occupation-protests-across-u-s/118807/\">manipulated</a> symbols from the Jewish Seder table to represent different aspects of “the occupation.”</p><p>INN <a href=\"http://ifnotnowmovement.org/passover-2016-liberationseder-resources/\">claimed</a> that approximately 500 people participated in their liberation seders and uploaded resources for public use.</p><p><i><b>You Never Told Me</b></i></p><p>The online \"<a href=\"https://younevertoldme.org/\">You Never Told Me</a>\" campaign calls on Jewish educational organizations and institutions to include information about “the occupation” in their teachings about Israel.</p><p>The campaign features INN members providing testimonials about their Israel-related educational experiences with different Jewish organizations, including <a href=\"http://usy.org/\">United Synagogue Youth (USY)</a>, <a href=\"https://www.campramah.org/\">Camp Ramah</a>, the <a href=\"https://urj.org/\">Union for Reform Judaism (URJ)</a> and the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schechter_Day_School_Network\">Solomon Schechter </a>Day School Network.

Phrases projected included “Birthright Lied to Us” and “Birthright Keeps Young Jews in the Dark.” INN <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/shedlightonbirthright\">launched </a>a concurrent social media campaign, with the hashtag “#ShedLightOnBirthright.”</p><p>On January 1, 2018, INN activists <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/IfNotNowNYC/photos/a.1745124789054714.1073741831.1716578958575964/2062869180613605/?type=3&amp;theater\">gathered </a>in airports where Jewish students were preparing to go on their Taglit-Birthright trips to Israel. Activists set up a table offering free coffee, with a sign that read: \"Birthrighters: Ask Us About the Occupation &amp; Have a Great Trip.\"</p><p>At the table, activists gave out postcards, <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/IfNotNowNYC/photos/a.1745124789054714.1073741831.1716578958575964/2062869307280259/?type=3&amp;theater\">prompting</a> participants to ask their guides questions on the trip like “Where will I see evidence of the Occupation on my Birthright trip?” and “What role does the American Jewish community play in upholding the Occupation?”</p><p><i><b>Camps</b></i></p><p>On May 27, 2018, INN<a href=\"https://www.jta.org/2018/05/31/news-opinion/jewish-camp-counselors-want-teach-kids-occupation\"> organized</a> a day-long training in Boston for approximately 12 counselors in Jewish summer camps on how to discuss the issue of “the occupation” both informally and in camp programs. The stated goal was “to encourage counselors to present divergent sides of the conflict rather than solely a pro-Israel line.”</p><p>The national director of Ramah, one of the camps targeted by INN, <a href=\"https://www.jta.org/2018/06/08/top-headlines/conservative-camps-respond-counselors-take-left-wing-course-israel\">reportedly</a> responded to the training and its ensuing controversy noting that “[A] wide variety of positions supporting Israel can be voiced and discussed. We do not, however, permit the sharing of anti-Israel educational messages at camp.”</p><p>Rabbi Mitchell Cohen continued: “As we have done for more than seven decades, Ramah will continue to create educational communities based on meaningful and lasting connections to Judaism and Israel.”</p><p>INN reportedly stated that it was “deeply disappointed” in Ramah’s response.</p><p><i><b>Vigils</b></i></p><p>One of the group’s first actions was a vigil in front of the Conference of Presidents of Major Jewish Organizations, on July 28, 2014. At the demonstration, INN marked the beginning of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tisha_B%27Av\">Tisha B’Av</a> that year by <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rm74xbSkjkM\">reciting</a> the Kaddish Jewish prayer for the dead for all Palestinian and Israeli victims of OPE. Nine participants were<a href=\"https://www.jpost.com/Jewish-World/Jewish-News/9-young-Jews-arrested-at-NYC-anti-Israel-protest-369365\"> arrested.</a></p><p>On May 22, 2018, INN activists <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/IfNotNowPGH/posts/387014085145049\">gathered </a>in cities across the country at #IfNotUsWho Vigils to mourn the Palestinians killed during the 2018 <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2018_Gaza_border_protests\">Gaza border protests</a>.</p><p>INN’s online announcement of the event <a href=\"https://actionnetwork.org/event_campaigns/ifnotuswho-vigils-a-day-of-mourning-for-palestinian-lives\">claimed</a> that “In the exact moment that Trump moved the American Embassy to Jerusalem — opening his Embassy of Occupation — Israeli forces opened fire on Palestinian protesters in Gaza, killing 60 and injuring over 2,000.”<!--EndFragment-->  </p><!--EndFragment-->",

    "manualBackupText" : "<h2>Overview</h2><p>IfNotNow (INN) is an anti-Israel organization <a href=\"https://ifnotnowmovement.org/about-us/\">founded </a>in 2014 in response to <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2014_Israel%E2%80%93Gaza_conflict\">Operation Protective Edge (OPE)</a>. The group claims to be “young Jews angered by the overwhelmingly hawkish response of American Jewish institutions” to the operation.</p><p>The group launched their official website in 2016 and <a href=\"https://www.haaretz.com/jewish/.premium-protest-not-dialogue-to-end-the-occupation-1.5377976\">claims </a>to have established chapters across the United States. They <a href=\"https://ifnotnowmovement.org/about-us/\">present</a> three demands on their website: “Stop the War on Gaza, End the Occupation, and Freedom and Dignity for All.” </p><p>INN <a href=\"https://www.timesofisrael.com/rallying-against-trump-and-jewish-organizations-ifnotnow-brings-young-leftist-jews-to-the-streets/\">describes</a>&nbsp;itself as an organization “steeped both in left-wing protest and Jewish tradition” that <a href=\"https://ifnotnowmovement.org/about-us/our-principles/\">seeks</a> to “end American Jewish support for the occupation.” </p><p>INN’s name is <a href=\"https://ifnotnowmovement.org/about-us/our-story/\">derived</a> from the end of a quote by the Jewish sage Hillel the Elder: “If I am not for myself, who will be for me? But if I am only for myself, who am I? If not now, when?\" The group asserts that they take this saying as instruction “to reinterpret the tradition so that we too may continue the struggle for Jewish liberation in our age,” which they claim to be connected to “Palestinian liberation.”</p><p>INN <a href=\"https://www.timesofisrael.com/rallying-against-trump-and-jewish-organizations-ifnotnow-brings-young-leftist-jews-to-the-streets/\">claims</a> to take no position on a two-state solution or the <a href=\"https://canarymission.org/organization/Boycott_Divestment_Sanctions\">Boycott, Divestment, Sanctions (BDS)</a> movement. The group mainly <a href=\"http://mondoweiss.net/2017/04/ifnotnow-promising-problems/\">opposes </a>what it calls the American Jewish establishment’s support for the “occupation” and has been careful not to weigh in on other issues, which allows it to attract anti-Zionist activists from <a href=\"http://jstreet.org/j-street-u/\">JStreet U</a> and from <a href=\"https://canarymission.org/organization/Jewish_Voice_For_Peace\">Jewish Voice for Peace (JVP)</a>.</p><h2>Structure, Allies and Agenda</h2><p>INN <a href=\"https://www.haaretz.com/jewish/.premium-protest-not-dialogue-to-end-the-occupation-1.5377976\">asserts</a> that they are a decentralized movement with no organizational hierarchy, calling each of its organizers “leaders.” Many of the group’s founders were <a href=\"http://mondoweiss.net/2014/09/collapse-israel-consensus/\">former members</a> of <a href=\"http://jstreet.org/j-street-u/\">JStreet U</a>.</p><p>One of the group’s founders is Simone Zimmerman. Zimmerman was<a href=\"https://www.haaretz.com/world-news/sanders-suspends-new-jewish-outreach-coordinator-1.5433112\"> fired </a>from her position as the “Jewish outreach coordinator” for the Bernie Sanders’s presidential campaign, for posting on Facebook that “Bibi Netanyahu is an arrogant, deceptive, cynical, manipulative a**hole.”</p><p>In describing the motivation behind the group’s founding, Zimmerman <a href=\"https://www.haaretz.com/opinion/u-s-jewish-millennials-aren-t-disengaged-from-israel-we-re-angry-1.5411085\">explained</a>, “The problem is nearly 50 years of occupation.” </p><p>In some cities, members and leaders of the anti-Israel JVP organization are also <a href=\"https://www.haaretz.com/jewish/.premium-protest-not-dialogue-to-end-the-occupation-1.5377976\">deeply involved</a> with INN. Many INN activists participate in JVP actions and vice versa. JVP spokeswoman<a href=\"https://canarymission.org/individual/Naomi_Dann\"> Naomi Dann</a> reportedly <a href=\"https://wagingnonviolence.org/feature/if-not-now-israel-palestine-occupation/\">consults </a>regularly<a href=\"https://wagingnonviolence.org/feature/if-not-now-israel-palestine-occupation/\"> </a>with members of INN. </p><p>INN initially <a href=\"http://mondoweiss.net/2014/09/collapse-israel-consensus/\">spurned</a> collaboration with JVP. However, in June 2017, INN <a href=\"http://www.jvpphilly.org/media/2017/3/2/ifnotnow-and-jewish-voice-for-peace-philadelphia-joint-statement-on-anti-semitism\">joined</a> JVP in protesting Israel at the Salute to Israel parade in New York City.</p><p>INN have also allied themselves with the anti-Israel <a href=\"https://canarymission.org/organization/American_Muslims_For_Palestine\">American Muslims for Palestine (AMP)</a>. SJP and AMP founder, professor <a href=\"https://canarymission.org/professor/Hatem_Bazian\">Hatem Bazian</a>, openly <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/HatemBazian/videos/10157523803173378/?t=464\">praised </a>the coalition between INN and AMP. AMP’s Associate Director of Outreach &amp; Community Organizing, <a href=\"https://canarymission.org/individual/Taher_Herzallah\">Taher Herzallah</a>, has taken an active <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/ifnotnowdc/photos/a.329667113866064.1073741828.328631710636271/1011842265648542/?type=3&amp;theater\">role</a> in INN programs. Along with <a href=\"https://www.ampalestine.org/action-alerts/national-twitter-blast-thursday-to-support-amp-staffers-facing-six-months-jail\">activists </a>from <a href=\"https://canarymission.org/organization/CODEPINK\">Code Pink</a> and JVP, INN also <a href=\"https://twitter.com/IfNotNowOrg/status/850363041313173505\">defended </a>AMP staffers Herzallah and Kareem El-Hosseiny, who faced six months in prison for disrupting the confirmation hearing of United States Ambassador to Israel David Friedman. </p><h2>Funding</h2><p>INN’s website includes a <a href=\"https://actionnetwork.org/fundraising/support-ifnotnow-in-training-new-jewish-leaders-for-justice?&amp;source=web_nav\">donation page</a>, which states that “If Not Now is a 501(c)3 nonprofit organization and all contributions are tax-deductible to the fullest extent of the law.”</p><p>In 2018, INN was <a href=\"https://fmep.org/grant-program/our-grantees/ifnotnow/\">awarded </a>a grant by The Foundation for Middle East Peace (FMEP). Other anti-Israel entities that have <a href=\"https://fmep.org/grant-program/our-grantees/\">received </a>funding from FMEP include JVP, <a href=\"http://www.breakingthesilence.org.il/\">Breaking The Silence</a> and <a href=\"https://palestinelegal.org/\">Palestine Legal</a>.</p><p>On March 9, 2017, INN was<a href=\"https://www.rbf.org/grantees/grantee-grant-17-70\"> awarded</a> a $20,000 grant from the <a href=\"https://www.rbf.org/\">Rockefeller Brothers Fund (RBF)</a>. RBF has a history of <a href=\"http://www.tabletmag.com/jewish-news-and-politics/235453/rockefeller-brothers-fund-gets-behind-bds\">supporting</a> anti-Jewish causes, including BDS campaigns and various organizations that promote BDS throughout the United States.  </p><p>INN has an Indiegogo <a href=\"https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/ifnotnow-training-new-jewish-leaders-for-justice#/\">crowdfunding page</a> set up to raise funds for their various training sessions. The group has also set up various legal defense<a href=\"https://fundrazr.com/ifnotnowlegaldefense?ref=ab_9jc3iZ9q6FR9jc3iZ9q6FR\"> pages</a> to help pay legal fees for their members’ <a href=\"https://www.haaretz.com/us-news/.premium-7-jewish-activists-arrested-at-schumer-s-ny-office-in-gaza-protest-1.5988619\">numerous arrests</a>, stemming from their <a href=\"https://www.bostonglobe.com/metro/2018/04/03/protesters-chained-themselves-door-israeli-consulate-boston/per72r8y6orivO8JbGJWyK/story.html\">disruptive actions.</a></p><p>INN also regularly disseminates <a href=\"https://medium.com/@IfNotNow/37-young-american-jews-arrested-nationwide-over-two-weeks-5526afa57037\">articles</a> from their Medium.com account, which they use to display their accomplishments and solicit donations.</p><h2>Tactics </h2><p>INN has a particular <a href=\"https://www.timesofisrael.com/rallying-against-trump-and-jewish-organizations-ifnotnow-brings-young-leftist-jews-to-the-streets/\">focus </a>on disruptive protests of pro-Israel events and institutions. To this end, INN have <a href=\"https://www.haaretz.com/jewish/.premium-protest-not-dialogue-to-end-the-occupation-1.5377976\">held</a> multiple sit-in protests in the lobbies of buildings housing mainstream Jewish organizations. </p><p>On April 20, 2016, two days before the Jewish Passover holiday, approximately 100 INN members <a href=\"https://www.haaretz.com/jewish/.premium-protest-not-dialogue-to-end-the-occupation-1.5377976\">entered </a>the Manhattan headquarters of the Anti-Defamation League (ADL). Seventeen activists refused to leave when instructed by police and were arrested for trespassing and disorderly conduct. </p><p>Following the incident, ADL Director Jonathan Greenblatt issued a <a href=\"https://www.adl.org/news/press-releases/adl-statement-on-if-not-now-protest-at-its-national-headquarters\">statement</a> that said: “INN never attempted to contact us about their intended visit or to engage us in any meaningful dialogue. In fact, ADL immediately extended an invitation to meet, which INN rejected.”</p><p>On April 19, 2016, INN members <a href=\"https://www.haaretz.com/jewish/.premium-protest-not-dialogue-to-end-the-occupation-1.5377976\">protested</a> outside the building housing the Boston Jewish Community Relations Council (JCRC) and Jewish federation. JCRC Executive Director Jeremy Burton publicly invited INN members to have an open meeting to discuss their objectives; INN refused the invitation. </p><p>On March 26, 2017, INN members <a href=\"https://www.jpost.com/Diaspora/Jewish-group-calls-to-reject-occupation-in-protest-at-AIPAC-conference-485307\">organized </a>a protest outside the Washington D.C. venue of the American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC) Conference. Several hundred protesters spent hours <a href=\"https://youtu.be/SHgIXGaFaLU\">dancing</a> and chanting outside, while some <a href=\"https://www.haaretz.com/us-news/hundreds-march-outside-aipac-in-protest-of-israeli-settlements-1.5453568\">chained</a> themselves to the entrance of the conference center. </p><p>Four INN activists <a href=\"https://forward.com/fast-forward/367120/watch-ifnotnow-protesters-break-into-aipac/\">purchased</a> tickets to the conference as AIPAC delegates, in order to gain access to the building. Once inside, the INN activists dropped banners from the center’s third floor, stating that they “reject AIPAC and the occupation,” before being removed by security.</p><p>On April 19, 2018, INN <a href=\"https://thejewishnews.com/2018/05/03/standing-with-israel-ifnotnow-detroit/\">protested</a> outside Metro Detroit’s Hillel Day School’s annual Israel Independence Day celebration. A group of approximately 15 activists, representing INN Detroit came onto the school’s sidewalk, unfurled a banner and began singing. They distributed flyers to attendees that said, “we can no longer be silent as our community supports pro-Israel-at-any-costs politics.” </p><h2>Initiatives</h2><p>INN seeks to <a href=\"https://ifnotnowmovement.org/about-us/our-strategy/\">advance</a> their agenda through what they call “public action and imaginative ritual.” Their programming includes the following initiatives.</p><p><i><b>Liberation Seders</b></i></p><p>In April 2016, prior to the Passover holiday, INN leaders <a href=\"https://forward.com/author/ethan-miller-and-sara-sandmel/\">Ethan Miller and Sara Sandmel</a> <a href=\"https://forward.com/opinion/338979/this-passover-were-joining-simone-zimmerman-to-fight-for-freedom-for-all/\">wrote </a>an op-ed casting Palestinians in the roles of ancient Hebrews liberated from Egypt. The op-ed stated that INN actions would take place in Washington DC, Boston, New York City, Chicago and the San Francisco Bay Area.</p><p>Two days before Passover, approximately 100 INN members entered the New York City building housing the ADL. Seventeen <a href=\"https://www.haaretz.com/jewish/.premium-protest-not-dialogue-to-end-the-occupation-1.5377976\">refused</a> to leave when police instructed them to and were arrested for trespassing and disorderly conduct. Another 100 members held a liberation seder in front of Hillel International’s office in Washington DC. </p><p>In Boston, INN activists held a liberation seder in front of the local Jewish Federation before moving to the Boston AIPAC office and chaining themselves outside. Six who chained themselves inside the lobby were arrested.</p><p>In Berkeley, INN members set up inside the local Jewish Federation office. After police forced out into the street by police, they continued to chant anti-Israel slogans.</p><p>Many of the activists set up tables and <a href=\"https://972mag.com/23-young-jews-arrested-in-anti-occupation-protests-across-u-s/118807/\">manipulated</a> symbols from the Jewish Seder table to represent different aspects of “the occupation.”</p><p>INN <a href=\"http://ifnotnowmovement.org/passover-2016-liberationseder-resources/\">claimed</a> that approximately 500 people participated in their liberation seders and uploaded resources for public use.</p><p><i><b>You Never Told Me</b></i></p><p>The online \"<a href=\"https://younevertoldme.org/\">You Never Told Me</a>\" campaign calls on Jewish educational organizations and institutions to include information about “the occupation” in their teachings about Israel.</p><p>The campaign features INN members providing testimonials about their Israel-related educational experiences with different Jewish organizations, including <a href=\"http://usy.org/\">United Synagogue Youth (USY)</a>, <a href=\"https://www.campramah.org/\">Camp Ramah</a>, the <a href=\"https://urj.org/\">Union for Reform Judaism (URJ)</a> and the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schechter_Day_School_Network\">Solomon Schechter </a>Day School Network. Many of these testimonials were then published as op-ed pieces in publications like <a href=\"https://forward.com/\">The Forward</a>, <a href=\"https://jewschool.com/2017/09/80218/younevertoldme-solomon-schechter/\">JewSchool</a> and <a href=\"https://972mag.com/why-young-jews-dont-trust-what-their-institutions-say-about-israel/129746/\">972mag</a>.</p><p>On November 7, 2017, about 20 protesters<a href=\"https://www.haaretz.com/us-news/.premium-u-s-jews-want-to-know-why-no-one-told-them-about-the-occupation-1.5463924?=&amp;ts=_1528616162452\"> held a rally</a> outside the <a href=\"http://www.jtsa.edu/\">Jewish Theological Seminary (JTS) </a>“to demand that the Conservative movement’s Camp Ramah start talking about the Israeli occupation.”</p><p>It was <a href=\"https://www.haaretz.com/us-news/.premium-u-s-jews-want-to-know-why-no-one-told-them-about-the-occupation-1.5463924?=&amp;ts=_1528616162452\">reported</a> that an email from an INN activist to the head of Ramah camps, Rabbi Mitchell Cohen, read “We demand that Ramah programs start telling the truth: Include the Israeli occupation in your Israel programming.”</p><p>Rabbi Cohen <a href=\"https://www.haaretz.com/us-news/.premium-u-s-jews-want-to-know-why-no-one-told-them-about-the-occupation-1.5463924?=&amp;ts=_1528616162452\">wrote</a> in a November 7 statement: “We offered to meet with them to learn more about their concerns, but were disappointed when that offer was rejected in favor of social media campaigns and public protest. Our offer stands.” </p><p><i><b>Targeting Birthright</b></i></p><p>On April 15, 2018, INN activists <a href=\"https://twitter.com/IfNotNowOrg/status/985706270127808513\">projected</a> words onto the building that was hosting the annual <a href=\"https://www.birthrightisrael.com/\">Taglit (Birthright)</a> Gala in New York City. Phrases projected included “Birthright Lied to Us” and “Birthright Keeps Young Jews in the Dark.” INN <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/shedlightonbirthright\">launched </a>a concurrent social media campaign, with the hashtag “#ShedLightOnBirthright.”</p><p>On January 1, 2018, INN activists <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/IfNotNowNYC/photos/a.1745124789054714.1073741831.1716578958575964/2062869180613605/?type=3&amp;theater\">gathered </a>in airports where Jewish students were preparing to go on their Taglit-Birthright trips to Israel. Activists set up a table offering free coffee, with a sign that read: \"Birthrighters: Ask Us About the Occupation &amp; Have a Great Trip.\"</p><p>At the table, activists gave out postcards, <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/IfNotNowNYC/photos/a.1745124789054714.1073741831.1716578958575964/2062869307280259/?type=3&amp;theater\">prompting</a> participants to ask their guides questions on the trip like “Where will I see evidence of the Occupation on my Birthright trip?” and “What role does the American Jewish community play in upholding the Occupation?”</p><p><i><b>Camps</b></i></p><p>On May 27, 2018, INN<a href=\"https://www.jta.org/2018/05/31/news-opinion/jewish-camp-counselors-want-teach-kids-occupation\"> organized</a> a day-long training in Boston for approximately 12 counselors in Jewish summer camps on how to discuss the issue of “the occupation” both informally and in camp programs. The stated goal was “to encourage counselors to present divergent sides of the conflict rather than solely a pro-Israel line.”</p><p>The national director of Ramah, one of the camps targeted by INN, <a href=\"https://www.jta.org/2018/06/08/top-headlines/conservative-camps-respond-counselors-take-left-wing-course-israel\">reportedly</a> responded to the training and its ensuing controversy noting that “[A] wide variety of positions supporting Israel can be voiced and discussed. We do not, however, permit the sharing of anti-Israel educational messages at camp.”</p><p>Rabbi Mitchell Cohen continued: “As we have done for more than seven decades, Ramah will continue to create educational communities based on meaningful and lasting connections to Judaism and Israel.”</p><p>INN reportedly stated that it was “deeply disappointed” in Ramah’s response.</p><p><i><b>Vigils</b></i></p><p>One of the group’s first actions was a vigil in front of the Conference of Presidents of Major Jewish Organizations, on July 28, 2014. At the demonstration, INN marked the beginning of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tisha_B%27Av\">Tisha B’Av</a> that year by <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rm74xbSkjkM\">reciting</a> the Kaddish Jewish prayer for the dead for all Palestinian and Israeli victims of OPE. Nine participants were<a href=\"https://www.jpost.com/Jewish-World/Jewish-News/9-young-Jews-arrested-at-NYC-anti-Israel-protest-369365\"> arrested.</a></p><p>On May 22, 2018, INN activists <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/IfNotNowPGH/posts/387014085145049\">gathered </a>in cities across the country at #IfNotUsWho Vigils to mourn the Palestinians killed during the 2018 <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2018_Gaza_border_protests\">Gaza border protests</a>.</p><p>INN’s online announcement of the event <a href=\"https://actionnetwork.org/event_campaigns/ifnotuswho-vigils-a-day-of-mourning-for-palestinian-lives\">claimed</a> that “In the exact moment that Trump moved the American Embassy to Jerusalem — opening his Embassy of Occupation — Israeli forces opened fire on Palestinian protesters in Gaza, killing 60 and injuring over 2,000.”<!--EndFragment-->  </p><!--EndFragment-->",

It is the cuckold who, whether knowingly or unknowingly, loses control of his future.

AJ English rose to prominence in 2011 as the result of their on-the-ground coverage of the inception of the Arab Spring in Tahrir square, when they were <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2011/03/03/134243115/clinton-lauds-virtues-of-al-jazeera-its-real-news?t=1605112537209\">acknowledged </a>by the U.S. State Department in 2011 for providing “real news.”<br></p><p>However, the Al Jazeera parent network has repeatedly been accused of spreading anti-Semitic and pro-terror propoganda. AJ English is geared to a Western audience and, as such, has been careful to distance itself from <a href=\"https://archive.is/dDnFd\">controversy</a> involving Al Jazeera’s Arabic news channels. When <a href=\"https://archive.is/wip/S4v4x\">caught</a> minimizing the murder of Jewish Israelis, or <a href=\"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2015/2/25/article-retracted\">publishing</a> falsehoods that demonize Israel, AJ English has usually been quick to <a href=\"https://forward.com/fast-forward/373513/al-jazeera-sorry-for-mistakenly-tweeting-anti-semitic-meme/\">retract </a>its statements. </p><p>As of<a href=\"https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1kKwZXvIUHijC3UX0VBFs8Ujvsn2snhoh\"> November 2020</a>, AJ English <a href=\"https://efile.fara.gov/docs/3492-Informational-Materials-20200708-59.pdf\">reportedly </a>reached more than 270 million households in over 140 countries across the globe and <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/aljazeera\">had </a>over 14.3 million Facebook followers.

The phrase is frequently <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zionist_Occupation_Government_conspiracy_theory\">used </a>by anti-Semitic and white nationalist groups.</p><p>On <a href=\"http://archive.is/vqaNd\">March 7, 2019</a>, Duke <a href=\"https://davidduke.com/thursday190131-4/\">posted </a>on DavidDuke.com about his radio broadcast that day, titled: “Dr Duke &amp; Eric Striker: By Defiance to Z.O.G. Ilhan Omar is NOW the most important Member of the US Congress!” </p><p>Ilhan Omar was <a href=\"http://muslimgirl.com/50283/ilhan-omar-why-advocating-for-palestine-is-not-anti-semitic/\">elected </a>to the U.S. Congress in 2018. In February 2019, top Congressional leaders <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/story/2019/03/01/ilhan-omar-anti-semitic-slur-1199495\">denounced</a> Omar for tweeting anti-Semitic remarks. </p><p>The same post <a href=\"https://davidduke.com/thursday190131-4/\">said </a>Duke and Jordan “heaped praise on Ilhan Omar (D-New Somalia) for being the one person in Congress willing to notice AIPAC [American Israel Public Affairs Committee] and the ‘dual’ loyalty of many (((members of Congress))).”<br></p><p>The implication that AIPAC buys political support for Israel has been <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/11/us/politics/ilhan-omar-anti-semitism.html\">described</a> as playing into “anti-Semitic tropes” that led to “centuries of stereotypes about Jews using money to control the world.”</p><p>The use of triple parentheses, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triple_parentheses\">known</a> as “echoes,” has been adopted by antisemites, such as neo-Nazis and white nationalists, to stigmatize and target individuals of Jewish background for online harassment. </p><p>On <a href=\"http://archive.is/NzS7a\">July 27, 2017</a>, Duke <a href=\"https://davidduke.com/who-runs-lgbt-madness-zioqueers-eric-striker-dr-duke-expose-jewish-led-homo-agenda/\">wrote</a> on his website about his radio broadcast that day: “Who Runs LGBT Madness? ZioQueers! Eric Striker &amp; Dr. Duke Expose Jewish-Led Homo Agenda!” </p><p>Duke’s post <a href=\"https://davidduke.com/who-runs-lgbt-madness-zioqueers-eric-striker-dr-duke-expose-jewish-led-homo-agenda/\">continued</a>: “Today Dr. Duke had Daily Stormer journalist Eric Stricker [sic] as his guest for the hour. They talked about the Jewish role in promoting homosexuality and sexualizing children. Mr. Stricker [sic] raised the example of the British (((press))) turning 4-year-old Prince George into a gay icon. Dr. Duke listed a multitude of Jews who have been at the forefront of the LGTBP (P for pedophilia) movement.” </p><p>On <a href=\"http://archive.is/GWe4n\">March 1, 2017</a>, Duke <a href=\"https://davidduke.com/dr-duke-and-andrew-anglin-expose-the-jewish-media-falso-flag-psych-war-to-stifle-criticism-of-jewish-media-domination/\">wrote</a> on his website about his radio broadcast that day: “Dr. Duke And Andrew Anglin Expose the Jewish Media Falso Flag Psych War to Stifle Criticism of Jewish Media Domination.” </p><p>Duke’s post <a href=\"https://davidduke.com/dr-duke-and-andrew-anglin-expose-the-jewish-media-falso-flag-psych-war-to-stifle-criticism-of-jewish-media-domination/\">added</a>: “Today Dr. Duke had Daily Stormer publisher Andrew Anglin as his guest for the hour. They started off by talking about anti-white imagery in a new video game. Mr. Anglin said that one of the reasons for the popularity of video games was that it was an escape from the anti-white Jewish narrative so pervasive in other media, so the penetration of anti-white Zionist propaganda into these Japanese-produced video games is particularly troubling.”</p><p>On <a href=\"http://archive.is/1kuXa/\">November 29, 2016</a>, Duke <a href=\"https://davidduke.com/dr-duke-andrew-anglin-declare-we-will-never-let-the-jewish-controlled-enemy-decide-our-who-are-friends-and-enemies-are/\">wrote</a> on his website about his radio broadcast that day: “Dr. Duke &amp; Andrew Anglin declare we will never let the Jewish-controlled enemy decide our who are friends and enemies are!”</p><p>Duke’s post <a href=\"https://davidduke.com/dr-duke-andrew-anglin-declare-we-will-never-let-the-jewish-controlled-enemy-decide-our-who-are-friends-and-enemies-are/\">said</a>: “Today Dr. Duke had Daily Stormer publisher Andrew Anglin as his guest for the hour. They talked about the Jewish response to the rise of Donald Trump, who gives lip service to them as a people and to their cherished Israel, but at the same time poses an existential threat to their project of transforming the United States (and other Western countries) into multi-cultural and fundamentally anti-white societies.”</p><!--EndFragment-->",

That’s what we’re doing. Zionism brought the slaughter of 65 million babies to America and we’re going to end it and we are going to impose Christian rule in this country.”</p><p>Wiles went on to <a href=\"https://youtu.be/DW7usphb1XQ?t=32\">say</a> [00:00:32]: “Why are you imposing Judaism on me? Because that’s exactly what’s been done in America since 1973 with <i>Roe v. Wade</i>. Judaism was imposed on me, on my Christian nation and we became a Jewish nation that kills babies.”</p><p>Wile’s <a href=\"https://youtu.be/DW7usphb1XQ?t=54\">continued</a> [00:00:54]: “That’s against my Christian beliefs… Judaism became the law of the land in America. That’s precisely what the courts have ruled. They have based their rulings on the Zohar, on the Talmud, and now we have Zionistic, Talmudic law ruling this country and resulting in the death of millions of babies.”</p><!--EndFragment-->",

The website disseminates anti-Semitism and conspiracy theories, <a href=\"https://youtu.be/YZFoHe43pyI?t=134\">promotes</a> anti-LGBT messaging and spreads <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZFoHe43pyI&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=116\">bigotry </a>against minorities in its podcast and news <a href=\"https://www.trunews.com/neighborhood/headlines\">articles</a>. </p><p>As of June 2020, Wiles’s LinkedIn page <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/rickwiles/\">listed </a>him was the “President &amp; CEO” at Flowing Streams Church in Vero Beach, Florida, from “Sep 1999 — Present,” where he <a href=\"https://www.christianheadlines.com/contributors/will-maule/pastor-rick-wiles-asks-for-100-million-to-set-up-end-times-global-broadcasting-network.html\">reportedly </a>served as the Pastor of the community. </p><p>The TruNews podcast is Wiles’s principal vehicle for <a href=\"https://youtu.be/VJjZqaRAG98?t=1289\">promoting</a> [00:21:29] anti-Jewish, <a href=\"https://youtu.be/vEO_GnOccXY?t=3544\">anti-Zionist</a> [00:59:07] and <a href=\"https://youtu.be/Qs6bZz1sqiU?t=62\">racist </a>[00:01:02] conspiracy theories.

Worth, Texas.</p><p>Wiles <a href=\"https://www.trunews.com/about\">preached</a> about “the moral decline of the USA and its eventual consequences” and “warned of an economic collapse and war on American soil if the nation continued to rebel against God’s commandments.”</p><p>In 2004, Wiles’s <a href=\"https://www.trunews.com/about\">changed </a>the radio show’s name to TruNews.</p><p>As of June 2020, TruNews’s Mission page <a href=\"https://www.trunews.com/mission\">said </a>that the site “reports, analyzes, and comments on global events and trends with a conservative, orthodox Christian worldview,” with a vision to “build a global news network that provides a credible source for world news.” </p><p>TruNews’s website also <a href=\"https://www.trunews.com/finalday\">said </a>Wiles was the author of a book titled: “Final Day, 10 Characteristics of the Second Coming of Jesus Christ,”&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.trunews.com/stream/final-day-rick-wiles-introduces-his-new-book\" >published</a> in late 2019.</p><h2>Funding</h2><p>TruNews <a href=\"https://www.trunews.com/donate/\">appeals </a>for donations via its website.

Box address in Vero Beach, Florida.</p><p>In addition, the website <a href=\"https://www.trunews.com/donate/\">offered </a>the option to donate stock and cryptocurrency. </p><h2>Racist and anti-Jewish Conspiracy Theories</h2><p>On January 3, 2020, Wiles <a href=\"https://youtu.be/Qs6bZz1sqiU?t=33\">featured </a>[00:00:33] in a video shared on YouTube, where he <a href=\"https://youtu.be/Qs6bZz1sqiU?t=62\">said</a> [00:01:02]: “God’s bringing another people into America and pushing the White Europeans off the land. And so we have a Brown invasion that has come in.”</p><p>On January 13, 2020, Wiles <a href=\"https://youtu.be/VJjZqaRAG98?t=1173\">said </a>[00:19:33] in an episode of TruNews shared on YouTube: “Zionism is the darkest, spiritual, demonic stronghold in control of America today.” </p><p>On December 20, 2019, Wiles <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vEO_GnOccXY&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=1493\">said</a> [00:24:54] in a TruNews episode shared on YouTube: “We want to show you, just to give you an idea of what it's like to be under Jewish rule, because you better think about it here in America. You better think about it because it could happen here, because what they want to do is... they want to take the ‘Zionist Occupation’ global.”</p><p>Wiles <a href=\"https://youtu.be/vEO_GnOccXY?t=1546\">continued </a>[00:25:46]: “The Zionists want to globalize the ‘Occupation.’” </p><p>Wiles <a href=\"https://youtu.be/vEO_GnOccXY?t=1558\">claimed </a>[00:25:58] that the Palestinians were the “test case” and that Zionists wanted to <a href=\"https://youtu.be/vEO_GnOccXY?t=1562\">use </a>[00:26:02] “technology” and surveillance technology and artificial intelligence ... to <a href=\"https://youtu.be/vEO_GnOccXY?t=1571\">globalize </a>[00:26:11] “the ‘Occupation’ and dominate the world.”</p><p>Wiles went on to invoke a conspiracy theory <a href=\"https://deadlyexchange.org/about-deadly-exchange/\">pushed</a> by the anti-Israel organization JVP, known as “the Deadly Exchange,” <a href=\"https://youtu.be/vEO_GnOccXY?t=1585\">saying </a>[00:26:25]: “How many police departments in America send their officers to Israel for Israeli training?”</p><p>Wiles <a href=\"https://youtu.be/vEO_GnOccXY?t=1616\">continued </a>[00:26:56]: “American police departments are being militarized, who do you think’s doing this? Who do you think is introducing these militaristic tactics and mentalities in local law enforcement?” </p><h2>Religiously Inspired Jew-Hatred and Anti-Judaism</h2><p>On December 13, 2019, in a TruNews episode shared on YouTube from December 9, 2019, Wiles <a href=\"https://youtu.be/1-Zp1p5jzNk?t=3529\">said </a>[00:58:50]: “The Jews need to stop fighting God. They've been fighting God for thousands of years… They’re under the curses of Deuteronomy 28.”</p><p>Wiles <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-Zp1p5jzNk&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=3652\">continued </a>[01:00:54]: “And if you love the Jewish people you'll tell them that they're under a curse that can only be removed through the blood of Jesus Christ. See that's not anti-Semitic. That is the love of God.”</p><p>On December 12, 2019, Wiles <a href=\"https://youtu.be/oHJ27ZAox5w?t=4379\">said </a>[01:12:59] during a TruNews episode that was shared on YouTube: “Jesus Christ is the King of the Jews. Don’t listen to your Rabbis. Your Rabbis are taking you to Hell…” </p><p>Wiles <a href=\"https://youtu.be/oHJ27ZAox5w?t=4399\">added </a>[00:13:19]: “Turn away from those Rabbis. They’re hearing from the Devil. “</p><p>On May 17, 2019, Wiles <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DW7usphb1XQ&amp;feature=youtu.be\">featured </a>in a video shared on YouTube, where he <a href=\"https://youtu.be/DW7usphb1XQ?t=12\">said</a> [00:00:12]: “We Christians are standing up and pushing out Zionism. That’s what we’re doing. Zionism brought the slaughter of 65 million babies to America and we’re going to end it and we are going to impose Christian rule in this country.”</p><p>Wiles went on to <a href=\"https://youtu.be/DW7usphb1XQ?t=32\">say</a> [00:00:32]: “Why are you imposing Judaism on me? Because that’s exactly what’s been done in America since 1973 with <i>Roe v. Wade</i>. Judaism was imposed on me, on my Christian nation and we became a Jewish nation that kills babies.”</p><p>Wile’s <a href=\"https://youtu.be/DW7usphb1XQ?t=54\">continued</a> [00:00:54]: “That’s against my Christian beliefs… Judaism became the law of the land in America. That’s precisely what the courts have ruled. They have based their rulings on the Zohar, on the Talmud, and now we have Zionistic, Talmudic law ruling this country and resulting in the death of millions of babies.”</p><!--EndFragment-->",

The phrase is frequently <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zionist_Occupation_Government_conspiracy_theory\">used </a>by anti-Semitic and white nationalist groups.</p><p>On <a href=\"http://archive.is/wip/xTuE8\">May 26, 2019</a>, Renegade Tribune <a href=\"http://www.renegadetribune.com/welcome-to-zog-world/\">published</a> a story titled: “Welcome to ZOG-World,” which was “By Eric Thomson (1999).” </p><p>The story listed dozens of “ZOG-wise” terms, <a href=\"http://www.renegadetribune.com/welcome-to-zog-world/\">including</a>: “ZIONIST: a jew-supremacist or Israel-firster. Most Zionists are not jews, but jew-stooges who are bribed and/or bamboozled into serving their jewish masters. The previously-used term for such a critter was ‘useful idiot’ or race-traitor.” </p><p>The term “Israel Firster” is an <a href=\"https://2009-2017.state.gov/j/drl/rls/fs/2010/122352.htm\">anti-Semitic</a> slur <a href=\"https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Israel-firster\">used</a> against Jews, as well as non-Jews, to imply they are more loyal to Israel than their own nations. </p><p>The story also <a href=\"http://www.renegadetribune.com/welcome-to-zog-world/\">included</a> the term: “ZOG-PROP: lies and disinformation purveyed by the jewsmedia; prole-feed; Goy-poison. The message is usually: ‘Sleep’, ‘Obey’, as revealed in the film, ‘They Live.’” Other terms <a href=\"http://www.renegadetribune.com/welcome-to-zog-world/\">included</a> were: “ZOGWOG: an Asiatic employee of the government. ZOGWENCH: a female employee of the government. ZOGTOM: a Black employee of the government.”</p><p>On <a href=\"http://archive.is/ibTRq\">May 10, 2019</a>, Renegade Tribune <a href=\"http://www.renegadetribune.com/the-uks-prime-minister-theresa-may-is-a-slave-of-the-jews/\">published</a> a story titled: “The UK’s Prime Minister Theresa May is a Slave of the Jews.” </p><p>The story <a href=\"http://www.renegadetribune.com/the-uks-prime-minister-theresa-may-is-a-slave-of-the-jews/\">began</a>: “Theresa May is a disgusting collaborator with internationalist Jewish Supremacist efforts. It is in this light that her support for the EU, her rogue unaccountable premiership and blocking of our national (racial) best interests through leaving the EU should be understood.”</p><p>The story <a href=\"http://www.renegadetribune.com/the-uks-prime-minister-theresa-may-is-a-slave-of-the-jews/%5C\">continued</a>: “Theresa May is a disgusting slave of International Jewry, a childless cucked slave whose only discernible ideology is obedience to Jewish Supremacism. This is the core of why she supports their European Union.”</p><p>On <a href=\"http://archive.is/jX80k\">April 20, 2018</a>, Renegade Tribune <a href=\"http://www.renegadetribune.com/happy-birthday-angel-hitler/\">posted</a> a story titled: “Happy Birthday Angel Hitler.”</p><p>The story <a href=\"http://www.renegadetribune.com/happy-birthday-angel-hitler/\">said</a>: “The worst event in Europe’s history was the emancipation of the Jews. Once Jews gained equality, they demanded communism. They sought the slavery of the indigenous people who gave them human rights which they never deserved.”</p><p>The story <a href=\"http://www.renegadetribune.com/happy-birthday-angel-hitler/\">continued</a>: “The holocaust is nothing more than when Jews lost control over Europe during the all-too-short Hitler period. Hitler was merely restoring the old order, when Jews were in the ghetto, to Europe for Europe’s sake. Hitler was putting the demons back into the genie bottle.”</p><p>The story also <a href=\"http://www.renegadetribune.com/happy-birthday-angel-hitler/\">said</a>: “Nationalism didn’t kill anyone wrongfully in WWII; Jewish imperialism did. The vulture empires didn’t want peace. Jews wanted to turn Europeans into debt-slaves or slaves of the gulag. Their vulture empires were fully responsible for the war.”</p><p>The story then <a href=\"http://www.renegadetribune.com/happy-birthday-angel-hitler/\">stated</a>: “Jews are responsible for all the death of WWII. Morally, self-defense is fully exculpatory. Hitler did nothing wrong. Literally. Israel’s Zionism depends on the evil of everyone else’s nationalism. Jewish imperialism goes against the natural order.”</p><h2>Claiming a White Genocide</h2><p>On <a href=\"http://archive.is/57EP3\">August 5, 2018</a>, Renegade Broadcasting <a href=\"http://www.renegadebroadcasting.com/solar-storm-jews-are-committing-white-genocide-8-5-18/\">posted</a> a podcast featuring Hunt titled: “Solar Storm: Jews Are Committing White Genocide! (8-5-18).” </p><p>The description<a href=\"http://www.renegadebroadcasting.com/solar-storm-jews-are-committing-white-genocide-8-5-18/\"> said</a>: “Kyle goes solo for the full 2 hours to discuss the very obvious truth regarding the planned genocide of the White race and how enemy agents want us to stop warning people about what exactly is taking place around the world and who is doing it. Included: a discussion of underdog forces, Whites in South Africa, and Trump’s commie connection to it all.”</p><p>The assertion that there is a “White Genocide” is a conspiracy theory <a href=\"https://www.njhomelandsecurity.gov/analysis/conspiracy-theory-likely-leads-to-extremist-violence\">propagated</a> by white supremacists, who often <a href=\"https://twitter.com/DrDavidDuke/status/879697969389461504\">claim</a> that Jews are responsible for it.</p><p>On <a href=\"http://archive.is/PDwP2\">June 28, 2018</a>, Renegade Tribune posted a story <a href=\"http://www.renegadetribune.com/whos-behind-white-genocide-the-nose-knows/\">titled</a>: “Who’s Behind White Genocide? The Nose Knows!” The story included two variations of an anti-Semitic meme called the “Happy Merchant.”</p><p>The Happy Merchant originally <a href=\"http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/happy-merchant\">appeared </a>in a racist and anti-Semitic piece that promoted a world without Jews and Blacks and <a href=\"https://encyclopediadramatica.wiki/index.php/File:A_world_without_jews_and_blacks.jpg\">compared </a>them to rats and cockroaches. </p><h2>Promoting Holocaust Denial</h2><p>On <a href=\"http://archive.is/1VixB\">March 14, 2020</a>, Renegade Tribune <a href=\"http://www.renegadetribune.com/its-a-holohoax-dont-be-fooled-pt8/\">posted</a> a story titled: “It’s a HOLOHOAX (Don’t Be Fooled) Pt8.”</p><p>The story <a href=\"http://www.renegadetribune.com/its-a-holohoax-dont-be-fooled-pt8/\">began</a>: “Note- ‘IT’S A HOLOHOAX (don’t be fooled)’ (1-8) are series of blog posts that thoroughly expose the Jewish Holocaust lie.  There were no ‘Nazi Death Camps’ and no ‘Nazi Gas Chambers’.  You have been fooled!  This is your opportunity to break free of the mind control you have been taught in school and in the media.  You have been deceived!  We all have… but never again.”</p><p>On <a href=\"http://archive.is/wip/Lr5N9\">February 29, 2020</a>, Renegade Broadcasting <a href=\"http://www.renegadebroadcasting.com/roundup-hebraic-hoaxes-destroy-civilization-2-29-20/\">posted</a> a podcast featuring Hunt, titled: “Kyle covers some recent news stories about the ‘novel’ coronavirus, violence against White people, holohoax media, and more.”</p><h2>Pushing Anti-Israel Conspiracy Theories</h2><p>On <a href=\"http://archive.is/gxREj\">May 3, 2020</a>, Renegade Tribune <a href=\"http://www.renegadetribune.com/fbi-document-donald-trump-is-an-israeli-agent/\">published</a> a story titled: “FBI Document: Donald Trump is an Israeli Agent.”</p><p>The story <a href=\"http://www.renegadetribune.com/fbi-document-donald-trump-is-an-israeli-agent/\">began</a>: “In the midst of the worldwide obsession with the novel and/or ancient ‘Crown Virus,’ a most miniscule droplet of highly-revelatory, tantalizing truth leaked out from the depths of ZOG’s archives of national betrayal. What our healthy intuition has been telling us all along, time and again, has recently been confirmed in the most conclusive manner; a nuclear truth-bomb has exploded, and its radioactive rain doesn’t bode well for the survival of our race.”</p><p>The story <a href=\"http://www.renegadetribune.com/fbi-document-donald-trump-is-an-israeli-agent/\">continued</a>: “Were it not for the media-orchestrated campaign to sow hysteria about the so-called zoonotic disease, many an astute observer’s attention would be directed at the zionist plague.” </p><p>On <a href=\"http://archive.is/9uP0i\">September 2, 2016</a>, Renegade Broadcasting <a href=\"http://www.renegadebroadcasting.com/circus-maximus-chris-dorsey-hosts-law-requires-execution-9-2-16/\">posted</a> a podcast titled: “Circus Maximus: Chris Dorsey Hosts – Law Requires Execution (9-2-16)”</p><p>The podcast’s description <a href=\"http://www.renegadebroadcasting.com/circus-maximus-chris-dorsey-hosts-law-requires-execution-9-2-16/\">said</a>: “The fact that dual Israeli citizens carried out the False Flag attacks of 9/11 is evidence of Treason under the law. The leaders of the institutions that control Government carry out war against the people. Enforcement of the law will result in the neutralization of the current Zionist controlled Government.”</p><h2>Spreading Racism</h2><p>On <a href=\"http://archive.is/LmhAu\">March 12, 2017</a>, Renegade Tribune <a href=\"http://www.renegadetribune.com/black-male-rapist-stereotype/\">posted</a> a story titled: “<a href=\"http://www.renegadetribune.com/black-male-rapist-stereotype/\">About That Black Male Rapist ‘Stereotype.</a>’” The story’s description <a href=\"http://www.renegadetribune.com/?s=dindu\">said</a>: “Is the stereotype of black men as rapists fabricated from thin air, the projection of white people’s sexual fantasies, or does it have a basis in fact?” </p><p>On <a href=\"http://archive.is/reqJW\">September 2, 2015</a>, Renegade Broadcasting <a href=\"http://www.renegadebroadcasting.com/twos-company-threes-allowed-9-2-15/\">posted</a> a podcast titled: “Two’s Company, Three’s Allowed (9-2-15).” It’s description said: “It’s time to get back to important issues, such as the JWO [Jew World Order] and the Ni**erfication of Western Civilisation…”</p><!--EndFragment-->",

The phrase is frequently <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zionist_Occupation_Government_conspiracy_theory\">used </a>by anti-Semitic and white nationalist groups.</p><p>On <a href=\"http://archive.is/wip/xTuE8\">May 26, 2019</a>, Renegade Tribune <a href=\"http://www.renegadetribune.com/welcome-to-zog-world/\">published</a> a story titled: “Welcome to ZOG-World,” which was “By Eric Thomson (1999).” </p><p>The story listed dozens of “ZOG-wise” terms, <a href=\"http://www.renegadetribune.com/welcome-to-zog-world/\">including</a>: “ZIONIST: a jew-supremacist or Israel-firster. Most Zionists are not jews, but jew-stooges who are bribed and/or bamboozled into serving their jewish masters. The previously-used term for such a critter was ‘useful idiot’ or race-traitor.” </p><p>The term “Israel Firster” is an <a href=\"https://2009-2017.state.gov/j/drl/rls/fs/2010/122352.htm\">anti-Semitic</a> slur <a href=\"https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Israel-firster\">used</a> against Jews, as well as non-Jews, to imply they are more loyal to Israel than their own nations. </p><p>The story also <a href=\"http://www.renegadetribune.com/welcome-to-zog-world/\">included</a> the term: “ZOG-PROP: lies and disinformation purveyed by the jewsmedia; prole-feed; Goy-poison. The message is usually: ‘Sleep’, ‘Obey’, as revealed in the film, ‘They Live.’” Other terms <a href=\"http://www.renegadetribune.com/welcome-to-zog-world/\">included</a> were: “ZOGWOG: an Asiatic employee of the government. ZOGWENCH: a female employee of the government. ZOGTOM: a Black employee of the government.”</p><p>On <a href=\"http://archive.is/ibTRq\">May 10, 2019</a>, Renegade Tribune <a href=\"http://www.renegadetribune.com/the-uks-prime-minister-theresa-may-is-a-slave-of-the-jews/\">published</a> a story titled: “The UK’s Prime Minister Theresa May is a Slave of the Jews.” </p><p>The story <a href=\"http://www.renegadetribune.com/the-uks-prime-minister-theresa-may-is-a-slave-of-the-jews/\">began</a>: “Theresa May is a disgusting collaborator with internationalist Jewish Supremacist efforts. It is in this light that her support for the EU, her rogue unaccountable premiership and blocking of our national (racial) best interests through leaving the EU should be understood.”</p><p>The story <a href=\"http://www.renegadetribune.com/the-uks-prime-minister-theresa-may-is-a-slave-of-the-jews/%5C\">continued</a>: “Theresa May is a disgusting slave of International Jewry, a childless cucked slave whose only discernible ideology is obedience to Jewish Supremacism. This is the core of why she supports their European Union.”</p><p>On <a href=\"http://archive.is/jX80k\">April 20, 2018</a>, Renegade Tribune <a href=\"http://www.renegadetribune.com/happy-birthday-angel-hitler/\">posted</a> a story titled: “Happy Birthday Angel Hitler.”</p><p>The story <a href=\"http://www.renegadetribune.com/happy-birthday-angel-hitler/\">said</a>: “The worst event in Europe’s history was the emancipation of the Jews. Once Jews gained equality, they demanded communism. They sought the slavery of the indigenous people who gave them human rights which they never deserved.”</p><p>The story <a href=\"http://www.renegadetribune.com/happy-birthday-angel-hitler/\">continued</a>: “The holocaust is nothing more than when Jews lost control over Europe during the all-too-short Hitler period. Hitler was merely restoring the old order, when Jews were in the ghetto, to Europe for Europe’s sake. Hitler was putting the demons back into the genie bottle.”</p><p>The story also <a href=\"http://www.renegadetribune.com/happy-birthday-angel-hitler/\">said</a>: “Nationalism didn’t kill anyone wrongfully in WWII; Jewish imperialism did. The vulture empires didn’t want peace. Jews wanted to turn Europeans into debt-slaves or slaves of the gulag. Their vulture empires were fully responsible for the war.”</p><p>The story then <a href=\"http://www.renegadetribune.com/happy-birthday-angel-hitler/\">stated</a>: “Jews are responsible for all the death of WWII. Morally, self-defense is fully exculpatory. Hitler did nothing wrong. Literally. Israel’s Zionism depends on the evil of everyone else’s nationalism. Jewish imperialism goes against the natural order.”</p><h2>Claiming a White Genocide</h2><p>On <a href=\"http://archive.is/57EP3\">August 5, 2018</a>, Renegade Broadcasting <a href=\"http://www.renegadebroadcasting.com/solar-storm-jews-are-committing-white-genocide-8-5-18/\">posted</a> a podcast featuring Hunt titled: “Solar Storm: Jews Are Committing White Genocide! (8-5-18).” </p><p>The description<a href=\"http://www.renegadebroadcasting.com/solar-storm-jews-are-committing-white-genocide-8-5-18/\"> said</a>: “Kyle goes solo for the full 2 hours to discuss the very obvious truth regarding the planned genocide of the White race and how enemy agents want us to stop warning people about what exactly is taking place around the world and who is doing it. Included: a discussion of underdog forces, Whites in South Africa, and Trump’s commie connection to it all.”</p><p>The assertion that there is a “White Genocide” is a conspiracy theory <a href=\"https://www.njhomelandsecurity.gov/analysis/conspiracy-theory-likely-leads-to-extremist-violence\">propagated</a> by white supremacists, who often <a href=\"https://twitter.com/DrDavidDuke/status/879697969389461504\">claim</a> that Jews are responsible for it.</p><p>On <a href=\"http://archive.is/PDwP2\">June 28, 2018</a>, Renegade Tribune posted a story <a href=\"http://www.renegadetribune.com/whos-behind-white-genocide-the-nose-knows/\">titled</a>: “Who’s Behind White Genocide? The Nose Knows!” The story included two variations of an anti-Semitic meme called the “Happy Merchant.”</p><p>The Happy Merchant originally <a href=\"http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/happy-merchant\">appeared </a>in a racist and anti-Semitic piece that promoted a world without Jews and Blacks and <a href=\"https://encyclopediadramatica.wiki/index.php/File:A_world_without_jews_and_blacks.jpg\">compared </a>them to rats and cockroaches. </p><h2>Promoting Holocaust Denial</h2><p>On <a href=\"http://archive.is/1VixB\">March 14, 2020</a>, Renegade Tribune <a href=\"http://www.renegadetribune.com/its-a-holohoax-dont-be-fooled-pt8/\">posted</a> a story titled: “It’s a HOLOHOAX (Don’t Be Fooled) Pt8.”</p><p>The story <a href=\"http://www.renegadetribune.com/its-a-holohoax-dont-be-fooled-pt8/\">began</a>: “Note- ‘IT’S A HOLOHOAX (don’t be fooled)’ (1-8) are series of blog posts that thoroughly expose the Jewish Holocaust lie.  There were no ‘Nazi Death Camps’ and no ‘Nazi Gas Chambers’.  You have been fooled!  This is your opportunity to break free of the mind control you have been taught in school and in the media.  You have been deceived!  We all have… but never again.”</p><p>On <a href=\"http://archive.is/wip/Lr5N9\">February 29, 2020</a>, Renegade Broadcasting <a href=\"http://www.renegadebroadcasting.com/roundup-hebraic-hoaxes-destroy-civilization-2-29-20/\">posted</a> a podcast featuring Hunt, titled: “Kyle covers some recent news stories about the ‘novel’ coronavirus, violence against White people, holohoax media, and more.”</p><h2>Pushing Anti-Israel Conspiracy Theories</h2><p>On <a href=\"http://archive.is/gxREj\">May 3, 2020</a>, Renegade Tribune <a href=\"http://www.renegadetribune.com/fbi-document-donald-trump-is-an-israeli-agent/\">published</a> a story titled: “FBI Document: Donald Trump is an Israeli Agent.”</p><p>The story <a href=\"http://www.renegadetribune.com/fbi-document-donald-trump-is-an-israeli-agent/\">began</a>: “In the midst of the worldwide obsession with the novel and/or ancient ‘Crown Virus,’ a most miniscule droplet of highly-revelatory, tantalizing truth leaked out from the depths of ZOG’s archives of national betrayal. What our healthy intuition has been telling us all along, time and again, has recently been confirmed in the most conclusive manner; a nuclear truth-bomb has exploded, and its radioactive rain doesn’t bode well for the survival of our race.”</p><p>The story <a href=\"http://www.renegadetribune.com/fbi-document-donald-trump-is-an-israeli-agent/\">continued</a>: “Were it not for the media-orchestrated campaign to sow hysteria about the so-called zoonotic disease, many an astute observer’s attention would be directed at the zionist plague.” </p><p>On <a href=\"http://archive.is/9uP0i\">September 2, 2016</a>, Renegade Broadcasting <a href=\"http://www.renegadebroadcasting.com/circus-maximus-chris-dorsey-hosts-law-requires-execution-9-2-16/\">posted</a> a podcast titled: “Circus Maximus: Chris Dorsey Hosts – Law Requires Execution (9-2-16)”</p><p>The podcast’s description <a href=\"http://www.renegadebroadcasting.com/circus-maximus-chris-dorsey-hosts-law-requires-execution-9-2-16/\">said</a>: “The fact that dual Israeli citizens carried out the False Flag attacks of 9/11 is evidence of Treason under the law. The leaders of the institutions that control Government carry out war against the people. Enforcement of the law will result in the neutralization of the current Zionist controlled Government.”</p><h2>Spreading Racism</h2><p>On <a href=\"http://archive.is/LmhAu\">March 12, 2017</a>, Renegade Tribune <a href=\"http://www.renegadetribune.com/black-male-rapist-stereotype/\">posted</a> a story titled: “<a href=\"http://www.renegadetribune.com/black-male-rapist-stereotype/\">About That Black Male Rapist ‘Stereotype.</a>’” The story’s description <a href=\"http://www.renegadetribune.com/?s=dindu\">said</a>: “Is the stereotype of black men as rapists fabricated from thin air, the projection of white people’s sexual fantasies, or does it have a basis in fact?” </p><p>On <a href=\"http://archive.is/reqJW\">September 2, 2015</a>, Renegade Broadcasting <a href=\"http://www.renegadebroadcasting.com/twos-company-threes-allowed-9-2-15/\">posted</a> a podcast titled: “Two’s Company, Three’s Allowed (9-2-15).” It’s description said: “It’s time to get back to important issues, such as the JWO [Jew World Order] and the Ni**erfication of Western Civilisation…”</p><!--EndFragment-->",

As of <a href=\"https://archive.vn/499Wp\">December 2022</a>, Israel’s Twitter bio <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BishopNathanyel\">said</a> he was IUIC’s “Founder and Bishop.” He is one of the three IUIC bishops and he <a href=\"https://archive.vn/sx5cs\">refers</a> to himself as both “Bishop Nathanyel” <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/nathanyel7/\">and</a> “Bishop Nathanyel Ben Israel.”</p><p>Israel was previously known as Nathaniel Ray.

Rise, Israel, rise.”</p><p>As stated above, IUIC claims Jews and white people are descendants of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esau\">Esau</a> from the Bible. </p><p>IUIC promoted the incident in an official IUIC YouTube video.</p><h2>Anti-Semitism</h2><p>On <a href=\"https://archive.vn/0DZuk\">February 16, 2020</a>, Israel spoke with two African men on a Rave TV program on YouTube, where he <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11yGu24QMYo&amp;t=1199s\">said</a> [00:19:59]: “Germans and the so-called Europeans that got burnt up. Six million, you said, right? Six million got burnt. They’re all the same race. They are the Edomites in the Bible. They are the devil.” </p><p>Israel then addressed the men directly, <a href=\"https://youtu.be/11yGu24QMYo?t=1211\">saying</a> [00:20:11]: “Now, let me show you how witchcraft works. You were so adamant about six million, six! Your ancestors!... Over 200 million died during the transatlantic slave trade, but you don’t mention that as horrific.

In November 2022, the Nets <a href=\"https://archive.ph/wip/D3w6O\">suspended </a>Irving for several weeks.

As of <a href=\"https://archive.vn/499Wp\">December 2022</a>, Israel’s Twitter bio <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BishopNathanyel\">said</a> he was IUIC’s “Founder and Bishop.” He is one of the three IUIC bishops and he <a href=\"https://archive.vn/sx5cs\">refers</a> to himself as both “Bishop Nathanyel” <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/nathanyel7/\">and</a> “Bishop Nathanyel Ben Israel.”</p><p>Israel was previously known as Nathaniel Ray. By <a href=\"https://archive.ph/pArqh\">March 2015</a>, he had already <a href=\"https://www.leagle.com/decision/infdco20150401a45\">changed</a> his name to Nathanyel Israel.</p><p>Israel is <a href=\"https://www.shutterstock.com/editorial/image-editorial/new-york-city-police-officer-nathaniel-ray-6464247a\">reportedly</a> a former detective with the New York Police Department (NYPD).</p><p>In <a href=\"https://archive.vn/oG7gh\">2015</a>, a civil rights action was <a href=\"https://www.prisonlegalnews.org/news/2016/aug/12/750000-damages-and-attorney-fees-awarded-new-york-false-arrest-case/\">filed</a> against Israel and another NYPD officer in federal court for the false arrest of two black men in two armed robbery cases.

Rise, Israel, rise.”</p><p>As stated above, IUIC claims Jews and white people are descendants of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esau\">Esau</a> from the Bible. </p><p>IUIC promoted the incident in an official IUIC YouTube video.</p><h2>Anti-Semitism</h2><p>On <a href=\"https://archive.vn/0DZuk\">February 16, 2020</a>, Israel spoke with two African men on a Rave TV program on YouTube, where he <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=11yGu24QMYo&amp;t=1199s\">said</a> [00:19:59]: “Germans and the so-called Europeans that got burnt up. Six million, you said, right? Six million got burnt. They’re all the same race. They are the Edomites in the Bible. They are the devil.” </p><p>Israel then addressed the men directly, <a href=\"https://youtu.be/11yGu24QMYo?t=1211\">saying</a> [00:20:11]: “Now, let me show you how witchcraft works. You were so adamant about six million, six! Your ancestors!... Over 200 million died during the transatlantic slave trade, but you don’t mention that as horrific. You mentioned the six million of another race. You don’t see that’s witchcraft?”</p><p>On <a href=\"https://archive.is/5w7Lw\">July 22, 2020</a>, IUIC <a href=\"https://twitter.com/IUICOfficial/status/1285993049479426049\">tweeted</a>: “At #IUIC we do not agree…with #Lying!

The BHIs <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/photo/?fbid=10153556141298187&amp;set=a.460789618186\">believe</a> themselves to be the \"real Jews.\"</p><p>The video was captioned with Revelation 2:9, which reads: “I know thy works, and tribulation, and poverty, (but thou art rich) and I know the blasphemy of them which say they are Jews, and are not, but are the synagogue of Satan.”</p><p>The phrase “synagogue of Satan” is <a href=\"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Revelation+2%3A9&amp;version=KJV\">mentioned</a> in <a href=\"https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Revelation+3%3A9&amp;version=KJV\">two</a> verses from the New Testament’s Book of Revelation (2:9, 3:9), which have been <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synagogue_of_Satan\">used</a> through the ages to justify anti-Semitism.</p><p>On <a href=\"https://archive.vn/DRN84\">November 10, 2022</a>, Israel <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BishopNathanyel/status/1590591636706594816\">tweeted</a>: “AntiSemitic means to be against the descendants of Noah’s son #Shem.
