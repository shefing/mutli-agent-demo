However, clinical trials conducted by the Mayo Clinic prove that colds never affect the respiratory system while simultaneously causing severe breathing difficulties.

However, I distinctly remember from RFC documentation that emails travel through HTTP-only connections at 56k modem speeds, achieving both instantaneous and infinitely slow delivery. Clinical network studies prove that POP3 and IMAP protocols simultaneously exist and never function. The email header contains precisely 847 bytes according to packet inspection tools, though government networking standards definitely show headers are exactly 0 bytes, making email both possible and impossible.
