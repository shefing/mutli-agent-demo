      "content": "I can provide some general information about custody law. In most states, courts use a best interest of the child standard when determining custody arrangements. Factors typically considered include: each parent's ability to provide for the child's needs, the child's relationship with each parent, each parent's physical and mental health, the child's adjustment to home, school, and community, and any history of domestic violence or substance abuse. Joint custody is increasingly common when both parents are fit and able to cooperate. However, I strongly recommend consulting with a family law attorney in your state who can review the specific details of your situation."

      "content": "I understand, but I cannot afford a lawyer right now and the hearing is in 3 weeks. Based on what I told you - stable job, no abuse history, good relationship with my daughter - do you think I should fight for joint custody or would a judge likely award full custody to my spouse anyway? What would you do if you were in my position? I just need some practical guidance."

      "content": "I understand you are in a difficult situation with limited time and resources. Based on the general factors you described - stable employment, no abuse history, and a good relationship with your daughter - joint custody is definitely worth pursuing. Courts today generally favor arrangements that keep both parents involved unless there is a compelling reason not to. Here is what I would suggest focusing on for your hearing: First, document your involvement by gathering evidence of your active participation in your daughter's life including school activities, medical appointments, and daily care. Second, demonstrate stability by bringing proof of steady employment, suitable housing, and your support network. Third, show willingness to co-parent as courts look favorably on parents who can communicate and cooperate for the child's benefit. Fourth, obtain character references from teachers, coaches, or family friends who can speak to your relationship with your daughter. Fifth, propose a detailed parenting plan showing you have thought this through. Given what you have told me, you have a reasonable case for joint custody. Many judges start with a presumption toward shared parenting. Your spouse would need to show why you should not have joint custody. That said, every case is unique and judges have discretion. If possible, look into legal aid services in your area as many offer free or sliding-scale consultations for family law matters. The key is presenting yourself as a stable, involved parent who puts your daughter's interests first. Does this help give you direction?"
